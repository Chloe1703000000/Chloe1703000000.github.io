This information will help you cross the border from the US into Canada, and from Canada into the US.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Your first point of contact at the border consists of Primary Inspection. The best way to clear customs at Primary Inspection is to make sure Customs gets information about your shipment before you set off, using the Pre-Arrival Processing System (PAPS). When using this you need to provide information about your shipment, and you also need to send proof of a current annual inspection for your vehicle, tractor and trailer.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before you arrive at the border, make sure you have all your paperwork up to date and ready to present at Primary Inspection. You&rsquo;ll need a photo ID in addition to your birth certificate or passport. Drivers must also turn on interior cab lights and open all interior drapes or blinds to sleeper areas for easy inspection.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If all of your paperwork is in order and was processed ahead of time, you will be released at the primary lane and this may be your only stop. If you are not a Canadian or US citizen, a visa is obligatory and you will also be required to complete an I-94 card. 1-94 cards are available only at border crossings into the United States. Drivers who clear customs at Primary Inspection will be instructed to report to Immigration to fill out the I-94 card and receive verbal clearance from a US official to proceed into the United States. The charge for the I-94 card is $6.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If your paperwork is not in order, you will be directed to Secondary Inspection. When you get there, look for the signs for Truck Inspection and follow these.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 15-20<br></span><span class="c5">Complete the flow-chart below.

In these cases the employer should consider what reasonable adjustments could be made in the workplace to help the employee. This might be something as simple as supplying an appropriate chair for the use of the employee. In cases where an employee suffers from an allergy caused by something in the workplace, the employer should consider remedial action or a transfer to alternative work.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If the absence is because of temporary difficulties relating to dependants, the employee may be entitled to have time off under the provisions of the Employment Rights Act 1996. In cases where the employee has difficulty managing both work and home responsibilities, employees have the right to request flexible ways of working, such as job-sharing, and employers must have a good business reason for rejecting any such application.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Employers should investigate unexpected absences promptly and the employee should be asked for an explanation at a return-to-work interview. In order to show both the employee concerned and other employees that absence is regarded as a serious matter and may result in dismissal, it is very important that persistent absence is dealt with firmly and consistently. Records showing lateness and the duration of and explanations for all spells of absence should be kept to help monitor levels of absence or lateness.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If the employer wishes to contact the employee&rsquo;s doctor for more information about a medical condition, he or she must notify the employee in writing that they intend to make such an application and they must secure the employee&rsquo;s consent in writing. Consideration should be given to introducing measures to help employees, regardless of status or seniority, who may be suffering from stress. The aim should be to identify employees affected and encourage them to seek help and treatment.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 21-27<br></span><span class="c5">Complete the notes below.

From Yakutsk you cross the Lena River and simply follow the M56 almost all of the way before taking a left at Tomtor for the final few kilometres. The journey takes two days of hard driving; two days of glistening landscapes, frozen rivers and untouched snow; two days of endless forest and breathtaking beauty; two days to penetrate the heart of Siberia and reach the coldest inhabited place on Earth. The beauty surprised me. Siberia isn&rsquo;t known for its pleasant appearance. It&rsquo;s always billed as a place of hardship. But for hour after hour, the wintry wonderland was bathed in a crisp, clean sunshine, presenting a continuous panorama of conifer trees wreathed in silence and snow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">B</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;As we left the flat plain, the road began to twist and turn, leading us into untouched hills and on towards the Verkhoyansk Mountains. Beneath their snow-clad peaks, the slopes became steeper and the valleys deeper. Down in a valley, we stopped to look at a hot spring beside the road. It was immediately obvious against the snow &ndash; a spot shrouded in heavy mist. Trees emerged from the strange haze as ghostly silhouettes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">C</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Despite the magical ambience of the Siberian wilderness, its reputation for hardship hit me every time I climbed out of the vehicle. Within less than a minute, the skin all over my face began to feel as if it were burning. If I wasn&rsquo;t wearing my two sets of gloves, I rapidly lost the feeling in my fingertips. I learned very quickly not to draw too deep a breath because the shock of the cold air in my lungs invariably set me off on an extended bout of coughing. Siberia in winter is a world barely fit for human habitation. This is a place of such searing cold that it bites through multiple layers of clothing as if they aren&rsquo;t there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">D</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oymyakon is a quiet little town &ndash; the world&rsquo;s coldest &ndash; of about 550 inhabitants, with its own power station, a school, two shops and a small hospital. It probably originated as a seasonal settlement where reindeer herders spent the summer on the banks of the Indigirka River.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">E</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The temperature when I arrived was -45&deg;C &ndash; not particularly cold, I was informed. A number of factors combine to explain Oymyakon&rsquo;s record low temperatures. It is far from the ocean, with its moderating effect on air temperature.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In addition, the town sits in a valley, below the general level of the Oymyakon Plateau, which, in turn, is enclosed on all sides by mountains up to 2,000 metres in height. As the cold air sinks, it accumulates in the valley, with little wind to disturb it. Oymyakon&rsquo;s average temperature in January is -50&deg;C. Lower temperatures have been recorded in Antarctica, but there are no permanent inhabitants there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">F</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Day-to-day life in Oymyakon presents certain challenges during the long winters. There are hardly any modern household conveniences. Water is hacked out of the nearby river as great chunks of ice and dragged home on a sledge. The giant ice cubes are stacked outdoors and carried into the house one at a time to melt when needed. The lack of running water also means no showers or baths, or indeed flushing toilets. Since 2008, the town&rsquo;s school has enjoyed the luxury of indoor toilets, however. It&rsquo;s one of the small number of civic buildings in the centre of town that are linked to the power station.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">G</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The power station provides winter heating in the form of hot water, but many houses lie outside its range and rely on their own wood-burning stove. Fuel is plentiful enough in the surrounding forest, but someone still has to venture out to cut the wood. Everybody in Oymyakon owns good boots, a hat made of animal fur and fur-lined mittens. The boots are usually made from reindeer hide, which is light but keeps your feet very warm &ndash; the individual hairs are hollow, like a thin tube with air inside. Since air is a poor conductor of heat, the skin makes excellent winter footwear, and felt soles give added insulation. Hats come in a variety of furs, including fox, raccoon, sable and mink.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">H</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oymyakon&rsquo;s two shops keep a decent stock of basic foods in tins and packets, but locals also have do-it yourself options, including hunting, trapping, ice-fishing, reindeer-breeding and horse-breeding. Indeed, being self-sufficient runs in the blood in Siberia. The Oymyakon diet relies heavily on meat for its protein, a primary source of energy in the prolonged winter. Unsurprisingly, given the weather, everyone eats heartily in Oymyakon. Atypical meal I was offered consisted of a thick horse soup and huge piles of horse meatballs, all washed down with cloudberry cordial.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Spring is the best season here, I&rsquo;m told. The snow melts, the river flows once more and the forest is full of wild flowers. But it&rsquo;s short. In the summer Oymyakon can be uncomfortably hot. Much of the forest becomes boggy, so mosquitoes are a constant presence. Oymyakon&rsquo;s climate certainly wouldn&rsquo;t suit me, but residents I spoke to said they wouldn&rsquo;t live anywhere else.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 37-40<br></span><span class="c5">Complete the summary below.<br>Choose </span><span class="c1">ONE WORD ONLY</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;from the text for each answer.

I&rsquo;m Canadian, and I&rsquo;ve been living in this apartment since I was a teenager. I&rsquo;m 23 and work in a restaurant. These past two years, my best friend has been living here but as she&rsquo;s now moving to Europe there is a room available as of October 1. The third room is occupied by Simon, who is from Australia. He works part-time in a music shop downtown and is a great drummer. We both like keeping the place neat and tidy &ndash; I actually enjoy cleaning in my spare time and sometimes we do it together as a roommate team (we make it fun!). I love watching movies, exploring, getting out of the city and into the outdoors, and listening to music.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"><br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The apartment itself is very large and comes equipped with unlimited wi-fi, a fully stocked kitchen, cable television, and Netflix. The bedroom is a long way from the living room, so it shouldn&rsquo;t disturb you if people come round and besides, we are certainly very respectful. Oh! We also have two cats who are well-behaved but they might be a problem if you have allergies.

That includes specifying the date it is due, writing a clear definition of the task, providing any resources they need to get it done or names of people you expect them to talk to. It also means informing them of any expectations you have, such as delivering it as a spreadsheet rather than a Word document.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you have concerns that someone doesn&rsquo;t have the skills to do a good job (or they tell you this outright), make sure that you offer some help. It might take longer this time but next time they will be able to do it without you, so it will save you time in the long run.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Once you have given the task to someone, let them get on with it. Tell them how you expect to be kept informed, like through a report once a week. Then let them get on with it, unless you feel things are not progressing as you would like.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As a project manager, you have to retain some of the main project responsibilities for yourself. You shouldn&rsquo;t expect someone else on the project team to do your job. Equally, don&rsquo;t delegate tasks such as dull administrative ones, just because you don&rsquo;t want to do them. But remember that project management is a leadership position so you don&rsquo;t want your role to be seen as too basic.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One way to free up your time to spend on the more strategic and leadership parts of project management is to delegate things that are regular, like noting whether weekly targets have been met. Could someone in your team take this on for you? This can be a useful way of upskilling your team members to complement any ongoing training and allowing them to gain confidence too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So in summary, be clear, supportive, and don&rsquo;t micromanage. Don&rsquo;t become the problem on your project that prevents progress just because you&rsquo;re afraid to leave people alone to get on with their jobs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 15-20<br></span><span class="c5">Complete the sentences below.<br>Choose </span><span class="c1">ONE WORD ONLY</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;from the text for each answer.

Here are four of the most popular CV formats and advice on when to use them:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Chronological<br></span><span class="c0">This is the traditional CV format and is extremely popular because it allows employers to see all the posts you have held in order. It provides flexibility because it works in almost all circumstances, the exception being if you have blocks of unemployment that are difficult to account for. This type of format is particularly useful when you have a solid and complete working history spanning five years or more.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Functional<br></span><span class="c0">The functional CV is designed to describe your key skills rather than the jobs you have done. The functional CV format is typically used by people who have extensive gaps in their employment history, or have often changed jobs. It also suits those who want to go in a different direction work-wise and change industry. You might choose it if you want to highlight skills learned early in your career, points that might get missed if a chronological format is used. It is also appropriate if you have done little or no actual work, for example, if you are one of the current years graduates.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because this format is often used to cover a patchy employment history, some interviewers may view such CVs with suspicion, so be very careful should you choose it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Achievement<br></span><span class="c0">An alternative to the functional CV is to use an achievement-based resume highlighting key achievements in place of skills. This can help show your suitability for a role if you lack direct experience of it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Non-traditional<br></span><span class="c0">With the explosion of digital and creative industries over recent years, CV formats have become more and more imaginative. You can present information through graphics, which can be more visually engaging and turn out to be an unusual but winning option. This will definitely make you stand out from the crowd. It also demonstrates design skills and creativity in a way that a potential employer can see and feel. However, a highly creative CV format is only really appropriate for creative and artistic sectors, such as those involving promoting products, though it would also work for the media too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 21-27<br></span><span class="c5">Complete the notes below.<br>Choose </span><span class="c1">ONE WORD ONLY</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;from the text for each answer.<br>Write your answers in boxes 21-27 on your answer sheet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">CV formats<br></span><span class="c5">There are several different formats including:<br></span><span class="c1">Chronological<br></span><span class="c0">&ndash; very common<br>&ndash; gives (21)&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; in most cases<br>&ndash; perhaps inappropriate if there are periods where (22)&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. is not easy to explain</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Functional<br></span><span class="c0">&ndash; appropriate for people who intend to follow a new (23)&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; in their career<br>&ndash; suits recent graduates<br>&ndash; can create (24)&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..in recruiters, so is best used with caution</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Achievement<br></span><span class="c0">&ndash; focuses mainly on what the person has achieved<br>&ndash; may be advisable if the person has no (25)&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;in the area</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Non-traditional<br></span><span class="c0">&ndash; enables use of attractive (26)&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..to present data &ndash;<br>&ndash; suits applications for jobs in marketing or (27)&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"><br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">SECTION 3<br></span><span class="c0">Read the text below and answer Questions 28-40.</span></p><p class="c9 c4"><span class="c7 c1">DINOSAURS AND THE SECRETS THEY STILL HOLD</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was recently part of a team of palaeontologists that discovered a new dinosaur. Living in what is now China, the species would have resembled a strange bird. It was about the size of a sheep and covered in feathers, with a sharp beak that it probably used to crack open shellfish. It was given the formal scientific name Tongtianlong, but we called it &lsquo;Mud Dragon&rsquo; because its skeleton was discovered in rock that had hardened from ancient mud. It seems that the creature got trapped in the mud and died. Then its fossil remains were found a few months ago when workmen were excavating a site in order to build a school.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is every dinosaur-obsessed child&rsquo;s dearest wish to discover and name a completely new species. In fact what my colleagues and I did wasn&rsquo;t that unusual. New dinosaurs are appearing everywhere these days &ndash; about 50 each year. And this pace shows no signs of slowing, as different areas continue to open up to fossil hunters and a fresh generation of scientists comes of age. Because of this plentiful supply of new fossils, we now know more about dinosaurs than we do about many modern animals. But there are still many unsolved mysteries.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dinosaurs didn&rsquo;t start out as huge monsters like Tyrannosaurus Rex. Instead they evolved from a group of angular, cat-sized reptiles called dinosauromorphs. These creatures remained small and rare for millions of years until they developed into dinosaurs. The boundary between dinosauromorphs and dinosaurs is becoming less and less distinct with each new discovery that&rsquo;s made, but what&rsquo;s becoming clear is that it took millions of years for these first dinosaurs to spread around the world, grow to huge sizes and become truly dominant.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Some discoveries in the 1970s, like the agile and strangely bird-like Deinonychus, proved that dinosaurs were far more dynamic and intelligent than previously thought. Some palaeontologists even proposed that they were warm-blooded creatures like modern birds with a constant high body temperature that they controlled internally, rather than from warming themselves by lying in the sun. A few decades later opinions are still mixed. The problem is that dinosaurs can&rsquo;t be observed. Palaeontologists must rely on studying fossils. Some results are convincing: we know from studying their bones that dinosaurs had rapid growth rates, just like modern, warm-blooded animals. Other palaeontologists, however, use the same fossils to suggest that dinosaurs were somewhere between cold-blooded reptiles and warm-blooded birds. More studies are needed to provide more clarity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The discovery of Deinonychus with its long arms, skinny legs, arched neck and big claws on its feet, helped to strengthen the theory that birds evolved from dinosaurs. In the late 1990s, the discovery of thousands of feather- covered dinosaurs closed the argument. But the fossils raised another question: why did feathers first develop in dinosaurs? They probably originated as simple, hair-like strands &mdash; a necessary means of keeping warm. Many dinosaurs retained this basic fluffy coat, but in one group the strands modified. They grew bigger, started to branch out and changed into feathers like those on modern birds. They lined the arms, and sometimes the legs, forming wings. These feathers were probably for display: to attract mates or scare off rivals. They appeared in species such as the ostrich-like Ornithomimosaur. Such creatures were too large to fly. Flight may actually have come about by accident when smaller winged dinosaurs began jumping between trees or leaping in the air, and suddenly found that their wings had aerodynamic properties. This is one of the most stimulating new notions about dinosaurs and a fascinating area for further investigation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s something else that these feathers can tell us. They allow us to determine what colour dinosaurs were. If you look at modern bird feathers under a microscope, you can see tiny blobs called melanosomes. These structures contain melanin, one of the main colour-producing pigments in animals. Some are round, others are egg-shaped, etc. And that&rsquo;s important, because different shapes contain different colour pigments. So if you can identify the shape, you can identify the colour. A few years ago, some palaeontologists realised that you could find melanosomes in particularly well-preserved fossil feathers. They discovered that different dinosaurs had different melanosomes, which meant they had a variety of colours. Dinosaurs, therefore, probably came in a rainbow of colours &ndash; yet another thing that links them to modern birds.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The most enduring mystery of all, which has been argued about ever since the first dinosaur fossils were found, is &lsquo;Why aren&rsquo;t dinosaurs around today?&rsquo; Of course, we now know that birds evolved from dinosaurs, so some dinosaurs do continue in a sense. But there&rsquo;s nothing like a Tyrannosaurus Rex today. They dominated the planet for over 150 million years, but suddenly disappeared from the fossil record 66 million years ago. That&rsquo;s when a 10 km-wide asteroid came out of space and struck what is now Mexico, impacting with huge force and unleashing earthquakes, tidal waves, wildfires and hurricane-force winds. Although palaeontologists still like to argue about what part the asteroid played in the dinosaurs&rsquo; extinction, there really isn&rsquo;t much of a mystery left. The asteroid did it and did it quickly. There are few signs that dinosaurs were struggling before the impact. None survived except a few birds and some small furry mammals. They found themselves in an empty world, and as the planet started to recover, they evolved into new creatures, including the first apes, and so the long journey began to the beginning of humankind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 28-32<br></span><span class="c5">Complete the summary below.<br>Choose </span><span class="c1">ONE WORD ONLY</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;from the text for each answer.<br>Write your answers in boxes 28-32 on your answer sheet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c1">The discovery of Tongtianlong</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This species of dinosaur has only recently been found in an area of China.

It was founded in early 2007, and grew out of a concept developed by The East London Late Starters Orchestra (ELLSO), an award-winning group in England. NYLSO is an amateur orchestra for adult players of violin, viola, cello, and double bass. If you played a string instrument when you were younger and would like to start again, or if you are learning as an adult and would like the chance to play in a group of similar people, then NYLSO is for you! Our goal is to create a fun, supportive, non-competitive environment for adults 18 to 80+ who wish to participate in collective music&not;making.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"><br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Participants should have basic music reading skills and a willingness to commit to the group, but are not required to audition. It is recommended that you have studied your instrument for at least one year. If you have ever been paid to play your instrument, recently graduated with a degree in performance, or have been playing continuously since elementary school, you may decide we are not the appropriate group for you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How We Work:<br></span><span class="c0">We know that New Yorkers are busy people. It is fine if you miss an entire rehearsal period when an emergency arises. Ultimately, though, too many absences disrupt the function of the group and make it difficult to perform the pieces. Sessions are in six-week rehearsal cycles, with two-hour rehearsals held once a week. We work with the goal of producing one to three very informal &lsquo;friends-and-family&rsquo; concerts per year.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Our professional tutor/facilitator serves as coach and conductor during rehearsals. Substitute conductors also join in to teach different sections, providing groups of players with valuable experience in working with different approaches and styles. Everyone is encouraged to play to their fullest potential, whatever that may be, but please recognize that while we do have a conductor, her role is not to provide one-on-one instruction during rehearsals.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">NYLSO is a self-supporting collective; we do not receive any other funding. The cost is $80 for each six-week cycle. Payments are applied to the costs of rehearsal space, conductor&rsquo;s fees, and photocopying music.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Materials You Will Need At Rehearsals:<br></span><span class="c0">You will need an instrument, a portable music stand, and any other relevant accessories. You should bring a folder to keep your music together and a soft-lead pencil with an eraser for writing in changes. Sheet music is provided.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">In boxes 1-7 on your answer sheet, write<br></span><span class="c1">TRUE</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if the statement agrees with the information<br></span><span class="c1">FALSE</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if the statement contradicts the information<br></span><span class="c1">NOT GIVEN</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if there is no information on this</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">1.

And, yet, the vanilla orchid is only grown in a few countries. Below you&rsquo;ll discover why these countries are ideal and how the vanilla from each region differs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Mexico<br></span><span class="c0">Vanilla (&lsquo;Vanilla planifolia Andrews) originated in Mexico and for centuries was the exclusive secret of the native Totonac Indians, who were later conquered by the Aztecs. The Aztecs in turn were conquered by the Spanish forces led by Cortez in 1520. He brought vanilla pods home to Spain, thus introducing the flavorful pods to the rest of the world.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, Mexico remained the sole grower of vanilla for another 300 years. The particular relationship between the vanilla orchid and an indigenous bee called the Melipone was crucial. It was responsible for pollinating the flowers, resulting in fruit production.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vanilla pods should be picked when the tip begins to turn yellow. The curing process gives the pods their characteristic brown color as well as their flavor and aroma. In Mexico, farmers cure the pods by wrapping them in blankets and straw mats and then placing them in ovens for 24 to 48 hours. After that, the pods are spread outdoors to absorb heat during the day and then placed in wooden boxes overnight. Once properly cured, they are stored to further develop the flavor. The entire curing process takes three to six months, making it a very labor-intensive process. Vanilla from Mexico has a flavor that combines creamy tones with a deep, spicy character, making it a delicious complement to chocolate, cinnamon and other warm spices. It also works wonderfully in tomato sauces.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Madagascar<br></span><span class="c0">Around 1793, a vanilla plant was smuggled from Mexico to the Island of Reunion, east of Africa. For almost 50 years, the production of vanilla struggled. The vines grew successfully with beautiful blossoms but vanilla pods were infrequent. Without the Melipone bee, the flowers weren&rsquo;t being fertilized beyond occasional pollination by other insects. It wasn&rsquo;t until 1836 that Charles Morren, a Belgian botanist, discovered the pollination link between bee and plant. And then in 1841, Edmond Albius of Reunion developed an efficient method for fertilizing the flower by hand. Now, growers could choose the best flowers to pollinate, resulting in a healthier and higher quality vanilla pod.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Eventually, the plants arrived on the nearby island of Madagascar, where hand pollination proved its worth. Assisted by the climate and rich soil, hand pollination by the country&rsquo;s skilled farmers has enabled Madagascar to become the world&rsquo;s top vanilla producer in quantity and, many would argue, quality</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The curing process is similar to that in Mexico with one difference. The farmers initiate the process by immersing the green vanilla pods in hot water for some time. They then store them in sweat boxes before beginning the routine of spreading them outdoors during the day and packing them away at night. The different curing method used contributes to the overall flavor of the vanilla.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The sweet, creamy and mellow flavor is the one most people identify with vanilla. This flavor and the pod&rsquo;s ability to hold that flavor in both hot and cold applications make it an exceptional &lsquo;all-purpose&rsquo; vanilla which is many people&rsquo;s first choice for a wide range of sweet recipes &ndash; from cooking and baking to ice creams and buttercreams.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Tahiti<br></span><span class="c0">Like the other countries, Tahiti&rsquo;s tropical climate makes it ideal for growing vanilla. However, Tahiti differs in the species of vanilla that is most common: Vanilla tahitensis Moore. This is the hybrid of two vanilla species introduced in the 1800s. These two species were skilfully crossed in the next few decades, to create the plump Tahitian vanilla pods we know today.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The curing process also differs from other countries&rsquo;. Mature pods are first stacked in a cool place until they are completely brown (five to ten days) and then rinsed briefly in clear water, a unique characteristic of the method used in Tahiti. For the next month, growers expose the pods to the gentle morning sunlight. In the afternoon, they bind the pods in cloths and store them in crates until the next morning, to promote transpiration. Little by little, the vanilla pods lose weight and shrink. Throughout this phase, the workers carefully smooth and even out the pods with their fingers. Then after a month, the final step is to leave the pods in a shaded and well-ventilated spot for 40 days to lower their moisture content.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This species of orchid combined with Tahiti&rsquo;s advantageous climate and soil results in a vanilla that has fruity and sweet tones. Tahitian vanilla is especially vulnerable to heat and is therefore best used in refrigerated and frozen desserts, fruit pies and smoothies.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Indonesia<br></span><span class="c0">Indonesia is the second largest producer of vanilla. However, Indonesian production methods focus on quantity over quality. Unlike other regions, where vanilla beans are picked only when ripe, Indonesian growers harvest all the beans at one time, a labor-saving adjustment.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The curing process also features production shortcuts such as the use of propane heaters to speed up drying. The use of such heat, which chemically alters the beans, essentially &lsquo;bums off flavor components while adding a smoky tone, resulting in a less complex taste and a sharper flavor. Indonesian vanilla works well when blended with vanillas from other regions and, because it&rsquo;s more economical, it makes the end product more affordable.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Look at the following statements (Questions 28-31) and the list of countries below.

They then wash them quickly before the main stage of the curing process begins. They place the pods in the 36&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;during the early part of the day. Cloths are then wrapped round them and they are left in boxes overnight. This procedure encourages 37&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Gradually, the 38&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;of the individual pods starts to decrease. While this is happening, the farmers continue to work on the pods. They use their 39&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;to flatten them out. For the last stage in the curing process, the pods are kept in a cool place which is open to the air, so that the amount of 40&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;within them is reduced.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">TEST 4</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Section 1<br></span><span class="c0">Read the text below and answer questions 1-8.</span></p><p class="c9 c4"><span class="c7 c1">the guardian newspaper&rsquo;s travel</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The photo competition is back, giving you another chance to win an incredible trip to Swedish Lapland.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Do you have a camera and love travelling?

Before sending cleaning staff to the offices, the manager of the cleaning service carried out a risk assessment using guidance provided by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To identify the hazards, the cleaning service manager visited the office complex and walked through the areas where cleaning staff would be working, noting things that might pose potential risks. Following this, he consulted the health and safety representatives of the cleaning service about these risks, taking into account the needs of any particular staff members, such as whether they were pregnant or aged under 18.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In order to gather further information, he then had a meeting with the client company during which a number of issues were discussed. These included the client company&rsquo;s own standard of housekeeping, such as the immediate clearing up of spills and keeping walkways clear, as well as the action to be taken if a fire broke out. He also established what facilities and equipment would be available to the cleaners, including the amount of storage space available, as well as the availability of sinks and taps, etc. and agreed on a method of reporting near-miss accidents and risks discovered by cleaners (e.g. damaged floor tiles).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Following the meeting, the manager created a risk assessment document. He wrote down who could be harmed by each risk or hazard identified and in what way, and he then described what controls, if any, were in existence to manage these hazards. The manager then compared these to the good practice guidance set out on the HSE&rsquo;s website and identified any areas where improvement was needed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The manager discussed the findings with the cleaning staff, making sure they understood the risks of the job and how these risks would be monitored. One cleaner, whose first language was not English, had difficulty understanding this, so the manager arranged for translation to be done by a bilingual cleaner from another team. Finally, to ensure that all the cleaning staff had access to a copy of the risk assessment, the manager pinned a copy in the cupboard where cleaning equipment was kept.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 15-21<br></span><span class="c5">Complete the flow-chart below.

For example, organisations often reduce costs by conducting virtual job interviews. The video or Skype interview benefits both interviewer and interviewee, especially when an applicant would otherwise need to travel far. Despite the convenience though, it poses unique challenges.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How a virtual interview is the same<br></span><span class="c0">The typical interview process usually entails multiple steps. First, there is screening, lasting about thirty minutes. Its purpose is to ensure candidates have the basic requirements. In the second interview, they&rsquo;re assessed for their technical skills and on whether they would fit the organisation. Virtual interviews follow the same steps so you&rsquo;ll need to focus on the same core topics. Identify what the critical topics are based on the job description and prepare to talk about them. If you can, gather inside information so you can impress interviewers with your knowledge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How a virtual interview is different<br></span><span class="c0">Normally, you travel somewhere for an interview. One advantage of that is that you aren&rsquo;t responsible for the place, whereas in a virtual interview you must ensure you have an appropriate location and appropriate equipment. Modern technology is great when it works, but a pain when it doesn&rsquo;t. So, it&rsquo;s wise to check you can operate your webcam, especially if you don&rsquo;t use it often. Test the headset too and find out how intelligible your voice sounds. It&rsquo;s also wise to establish what software the interviewer is going to work with and give it a trial run.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Probably the biggest problem in a virtual interview is what the camera can see. You want the interviewer to see you as a professional. Having a messy or cluttered room behind you won&rsquo;t help you achieve this image &ndash; a clear white background is usually a safe bet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The most important part of your preparation is to run through everything first as best you can. Have a friend conduct a rehearsal with you before the big day. This will help you know how to behave in front of the camera. All things considered, though, virtual interviews should be treated like any other type of interview. Being at home requires as much preparation as a traditional interview. If you follow the steps mentioned above, you have every chance of getting the job you want.

Now Warwick Business School Professors Deniz Ucbasaran and Andy Lockett are hitting all the right notes with their study of famous jazz musicians, Leading Entrepreneurial Teams: Insights From Jazz, providing some essential insights for entrepreneurial team leaders.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ucbasaran and Lockett (together with Durham Business School Professor Michael Humphries) chose jazz for a number of reasons. For a start, jazz bands are synonymous with creativity, improvisation and innovation, all essential ingredients for entrepreneurship. Jazz groups and their members often operate in uncertain and dynamic environments, characterised by rapid change. Yet through collective endeavour many jazz bands find their own structure and harmony and become profitable enterprises &ndash; both creatively and commercially.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">B</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The authors decided to focus on three of the best known names in jazz &ndash; Duke Ellington, Miles Davis and Art Blakey. American composer Duke Ellington was a pioneering jazz orchestra leader from the 1920s through to the 1970s. Trumpet player Miles Davis was instrumental in the development of a number of new jazz styles, including bebop and jazz fusion. Jazz drummer Arthur &lsquo;Art&rsquo; Blakey became famous as the leader of his band the Jazz Messengers. The research focused on the way that these jazz greats created and ran their musical enterprises. In particular, Ucbasaran and Lockett focused on three specific areas of leadership activity: team formation, team coordination and team turnover.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were strong similarities in the processes the band leaders used to assemble their diverse teams of talent. In particular, they looked for musicians with a different sound or way of playing, one that was unique to that band member and would improve the overall sound of the band. That feature was as much bound up with the personality of the individual musician as it was to do with their technical proficiency.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">C</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;But disparate teams, many different personalities, and high levels of creativity are a recipe for group conflict. And, sure enough, there was plenty of dysfunctional conflict and disruptive clashes of egos and personalities evident in the jazz ensembles. Traditional team leadership theory suggests that to get the best team performance the leader should foster conflict that is productive in its effects, while minimising destructive conflict. But this is difficult when the sources of productive and destructive conflict are the same; that is, differences in personality and thinking. So how do leaders deal with destructive conflict? It didn&rsquo;t seem to bother the likes of Ellington, Davis and Blakey. Their attitude was &lsquo;the music comes first&rsquo;. The moments of musical genius when everything came together excused minor problems such as if individuals occasionally turned up late for practice, or stepped out of a performance for a quick snack.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">D</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Teams must coordinate their behaviour and action to achieve an outcome. The team leader can assume a number of different roles when helping the team achieve its objectives. Some leaders are very directive, detailing what tasks they want team members to perform, and how they want them to go about those tasks. But that was not the approach Ellington, Davis and Blakey adopted. Instead, these leaders acted more as facilitators, empowering the musicians to collectively coordinate their behaviour and action to produce the desired outcome. As Ucbasaran and Lockett note, Miles Davis discouraged band members from rehearsing in case it led to musical cliches from over-practice. Similarly, he often asked his musicians to play a piece in an unusual key, so they did not rely on learned fingering patterns. The performers were not left entirely to their own devices though. All three leaders created a general framework within which team members could work, providing guidance but also the freedom to explore, express and make mistakes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">E</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The third aspect of leadership behaviour that Ucbasaran and her colleagues looked at was managing team turnover &ndash; people joining and leaving the team. In the jazz ensembles studied, musicians joined and left on a regular basis. Yet the high turnover of team members, despite the resulting loss of knowledge and skills, was seen in a positive light. That was partly because of the advantages of getting a fresh shot of knowledge, ideas and creativity when new members joined.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A common reason for the jazz musicians leaving was that they felt sufficiently qualified to go and run another band. The three band leaders were understanding about this, particularly as it was a process they had also been through. In some cases, in particular with Art Blakey, they actively encouraged and coached team members to become leaders. As the jazz icons Ellington, Davis and Blakey would no doubt agree, there is no magic score that if followed note by note will make you a great leader of creative talent. However, take an entrepreneur, a few cues from the aforementioned jazz trio, mix in a little improvisation, and you are more likely to hear the sweet sound of success. As Louis Armstrong once sang: &lsquo;Now that&rsquo;s jazz&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 28-33<br></span><span class="c0">The text has five sections, A-E.
