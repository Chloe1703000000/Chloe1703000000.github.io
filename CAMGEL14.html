c0">TRANSITION CAKE FOR THE ELOEHLY</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What is transition care?<br></span><span class="c1">Transition care is for older people who have been receiving medical treatment, but need more help to recover, and time to make a decision about the best place for them to live in the longer term. You can only access transition care directly from hospital.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Transition care is focused on individual goals and therapies and is given for a limited time only. It offers access to a package of services that may include:<br>&bull; low-intensity therapy such as physiotherapy (exercise, mobility, strength and balance) and podiatry (foot care)<br>&bull; access to a social worker<br>&bull; nursing support for clinical care such as wound care<br>&bull; personal care</span></p><p class="c6 c7 c10"><span class="c1"><br></span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c8"><br></span><span class="c0">Who provides transition care services?<br></span><span class="c1">Transition care is often provided by non-government organisations and is subsidised by the government. If your circumstances allow, it is expected you&rsquo;ll contribute to the cost of your care.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Daily care fees are set by the organisation that provides your transition care services (your service provider). They should explain these fees to you, and the amount charged should form part of the agreement between you and the service provider. The fee is calculated on a daily basis.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Where do I receive transition care?<br></span><span class="c1">Transition care is provided in your own home or in a &lsquo;live-in&rsquo; setting. This setting can be part of an existing aged-care home or health facility such as a separate wing of a hospital.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What if I&rsquo;m already receiving services through a different programme?<br></span><span class="c1">If you&rsquo;re already receiving subsidised residential care in an aged-care home, but you need to go somewhere else for transition care, your place in the aged-care home will be held until you return.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Questions 1-6<br></span><span class="c1">Do the following statements agree with the information given in the text on page 16? In boxes 1-6 on your answer sheet, write</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">TRUE</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;if the statement agrees with the information<br></span><span class="c0">FALSE</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;if the statement contradicts the information<br></span><span class="c0">NOT GIVEN</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;if there is no information on this</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">1. Only hospital patients can go on to have transition care.<br>2. Transition care may be long term or short term.<br>3. Everyone receiving transition care must contribute to the cost.<br>4. Transition care at home is only available for patients who live alone.<br>5.Transition care may be given on a hospital site.<br>6. You may lose your place in a care home if you have to leave it to receive transition care.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Read the text below and answer Questions 7-14.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13 c0">CABIN BAGS FOR AIR TRAVEL</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If you want a small bag with wheels that you can take onto the plane with you, there&rsquo;s a wide choice. Here are some of the best.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Flyer B3 is an ultra-lightweight cabin bag which can withstand some pretty harsh treatment, its nylon and polyester sides won&rsquo;t rip or burst open if it&rsquo;s dropped or thrown whilst in transit. However, the trolley handle feels quite thin and flimsy. The top carrying handle is hard and flat, and the side handle isn&rsquo;t easy to grip.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">B</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Lightglide has two external pockets, both of which are zipped and lockable, but the inside pocket does not zip. In tests, we found the contents remain dry when given a good soaking, even around the zips. The trolley handle has a choice of two heights and the plastic hand grip doesn&rsquo;t have any sharp ridges that&rsquo;ll make your hands sore. For carrying there are fabric handles at the top and side.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">C</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Foxton is easy to control across most surfaces. However, the zips don&rsquo;t always run smoothly especially around the corners, so you may have to give them a good tug, especially if the case is very full. This is definitely one to avoid if you&rsquo;re going somewhere rainy as it lets loads of water in, and documents in the pockets will also get pretty wet unless they&rsquo;re in plastic folders.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">D</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Skybag has a single external zipped pocket and another located inside the lid. Your clothes are kept in place by two adjustable straps. The zips, are easy to grip and they run smoothly around the case. However, this cabin bag felt a little heavy to pull on all but smooth floors, and it was hard to steer compared with some of the other suitcases.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">E</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Travelsure 35 is available in a huge range of fabric designs including leopard print or lipstick kisses. The retractable trolley handle is comfortable but can&rsquo;t be adjusted to suit users of different heights. There&rsquo;s no internal divider, but there are two handy zipped pockets in the lid. We test each bag by letting it fall onto a hard . floor &ndash; and our results show that you&rsquo;ll have to treat this bag with great care if you want it to last. The fabric tore so badly at one of the corners that it was unusable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Questions 7-14<br></span><span class="c1">The text above has five paragraphs, A-E.<br>Which paragraph mentions the following?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Write the correct letter, A-E, in boxes 7-14 on your answer sheet. NB You may use any letter more than once.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">7. The zips on this cabin bag may be difficult to use.<br>8. This cabin bag may be badly damaged if it is dropped.<br>9. The handles of this cabin bag have a number of different problems.<br>10. This cabin bag is very resistant to water.<br>11. There&rsquo;s a good choice of patterns for the fabric of this cabin bag.<br>12. This cabin bag isn&rsquo;t very easy to move around.<br>13. This cabin bag has just one internal zipped pocket.<br>14. The trolley handle of this cabin bag is adjustable.</span></p><p class="c6 c7 c10"><span class="c1"><br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">SECTION 2: Questions 15-27<br></span><span class="c1">Read the text below and answer Questions 15-20</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13 c0">College car parking policy &ndash; staff</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Parking permits and tickets<br></span><span class="c1">Staff permits are required to park a motor vehicle (other than a motorcycle parked in the cycle bays) on campus between 8.30 am and 4.30 pm, Monday to Friday, during term time. Annual permits can be purchased from the Hospitality Department. Application forms can be downloaded from the College website. All permits/tickets must be clearly displayed in the windscreen of vehicles during the dates of term time, as published in the academic calendar. Please inform the Services Administrator of any changes to registration details on telephone ext. 406. Annual car parking permits can be purchased from 20th September and are valid for one academic year from 1st October to 30th June. The annual charges for car parking are displayed on the application form.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Enforcement<br></span><span class="c1">The nominated contractor will issue fixed Penalty Charge Notices (see below) on vehicles that fail to display a valid permit and/or parking ticket, or vehicles that are parked on yellow lines or in disabled parking bays without displaying a blue disabled-parking permit. Reductions of parking space availability may arise in order to accommodate College recruitment activities and/or estate development/maintenance projects. Vehicles that are in breach of the policy will be issued with a Penalty Charge Notice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Penalty Charge Notice (PCM)<br></span><span class="c1">The PCN is &pound;30, increasing to &pound;60 seven days after issue. The nominated contractor is responsible for the collection of unpaid PCNs and may use legal action where necessary to recover unpaid PCNs. If issued with a PCN, appeals must be taken up directly with the parking enforcement company (details included on the notice) not the college.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Disabled parking<br></span><span class="c1">The college has designated car parking spaces for disabled car drivers. The college will make all reasonable efforts to ensure these parking spaces are used only by drivers who display their blue disabled-parking permits, and a valid pay-and-display or annual permit, as appropriate.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If issues arise concerning the availability of the parking spaces, those concerned should raise the matter with the Domestic Services Department in order to effect a temporary solution.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Visitors<br></span><span class="c1">The College welcomes visitors and provides parking arrangements through pre-arranged permits, which must be displayed in the vehicle. Please contact the Hospitality Department for further information, On Open Days, sections of car parking on campus may be reserved for visitors.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Short-term drop-off/pick-up provision<br></span><span class="c1">There will be two short-term drop-off/pick-up spaces for users of the nursery, with a maximum often minutes&rsquo; waiting time allowed. These are located outside Concorde Building. The nursery staff bays may not be used under any circumstances.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Questions 15-20<br></span><span class="c8">Answer the questions below.<br>Choose </span><span class="c0">NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;from the text for each answer.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Write your answers in boxes 15-20 on your answer sheet</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">15.

Who is responsible for giving out parking fines if you park in the wrong place?<br>19. What do visitors need to show when parking?<br>20. Where can the nursery pick-up point be found?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Read the text below and answer Questions 21-27.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13 c0">Maternity benefits</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If you are expecting a baby, there are a number of benefit schemes that could help you financially. However, eligibility differs for each individual scheme.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Statutory Maternity Pay (SSVSP)<br></span><span class="c1">You may be entitled to Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) from your employer. This is a weekly payment, to help make it easier for you to take time off, both before and after the birth of your baby. SMP can be paid for up to 39 weeks.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You are entitled to SMP if you have been employed by the same company for at least 26 weeks by the end of the 15th week before your baby is due. You must also be earning an average of at least &pound;87 per week (before tax). The amount you get depends on how much you earn. For 6 weeks, you will receive 90% of your average weekly earnings. Then you will receive &pound;112.75 per week for the remaining 33 weeks.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Maternity Allowance (MA)<br></span><span class="c1">Maternity Allowance (MA) is available to those who are employed or self-employed but not eligible for Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP). You may be entitled to Maternity Allowance if you have been employed or self-employed for at least 26 weeks in the 66 weeks before you are due to give birth. You don&rsquo;t have to work for the same employer for those 26 weeks. You also don&rsquo;t have to work full weeks (as a part week counts as a full week) during the same period. Maternity Allowance can be paid for up to 39 weeks, and is either paid at the same standard rate as SMP or 90% of your average weekly earnings. You&rsquo;ll receive whichever amount is the lower. You can find Maternity Allowance forms at antenatal clinics throughout the country.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Child Tax Credit<br></span><span class="c1">If you&rsquo;re on a low income, over 16, and are responsible for at least one child, you may also be entitled to Child Tax Credit. The amount you get will depend on your personal circumstances and income. When your income is being assessed, any child benefit, maintenance payments or Maternity Allowance payments will not be classed as income. This means that it will not be taken into account when calculating your Child Tax Credit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sure Start Maternity Payments<br></span><span class="c1">If you get benefits or Child Tax Credit because you&rsquo;re on a low income, then you may be entitled to Sure Start Maternity Payments. These are individual grants to help towards the cost of a new baby.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Questions 21-27<br></span><span class="c8">Answer the questions below.<br>Choose </span><span class="c0">NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;from the text for each answer.<br>Write your answers in boxes 21-27 on your answer sheet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">21. What is the minimum period you must have worked for an employer in order to be eligible for SMP?<br>22. For how long is SMP payable every week as a percentage of your average weekly earnings?<br>23. What sum is payable every week as the second part of SMP entitlement?<br>24. What is the maximum length of time MA is payable?<br>25. Where can MA forms be obtained?<br>26. Apart from income, what else is considered when assessing how much Child Tax Credit is paid?<br>27.

Bureaucracies have become the backbone of civilizations, as governments try to keep track of populations, business transactions and taxes. At a personal level, our lives are governed by the documents we possess; we are certified on paper literally from birth to death. And written documentation carries enormous cultural importance: consider the consequences of signing the Foundation Document of the United Nations or the Convention on Biological Diversity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Documentation requires a writing tool and a surface upon which to record the information permanently. About 5,000 years ago, the Sumerians started to use reeds or sticks to make marks on mud blocks which were then baked, but despite being fireproof, these were difficult to store. Other cultures used more flexible but less permanent surfaces, including animal skins and wood strips. In western culture, the adoption of papyrus was to have a great impact. Sheets of papyrus not only provide an invaluable record of people&rsquo;s daily lives, they can also be dated using carbon-dating techniques, giving precise information about the age of the text written on them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">B</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Papyrus is strongly associated with Egyptian culture, although all the ancient civilizations around the Mediterranean used it. The papyrus sedge is a tall grass-like plant. It was harvested from shallow water and swamplands on the banks of the River Nile. Manufacturing sheets of papyrus from papyrus sedge was a complex, messy process. Pith from inside the plant&rsquo;s stem was cut into long strips that were laid side by side. These were then covered with a second layer of strips which were laid at right angles to the first, then soaked in water and hammered together. The sheet was then crushed to extract the water, dried and then polished to produce a high-quality writing surface, individual sheets could be glued together and rolled up to make scrolls or folded and bound to form books.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">C</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;In moist climates the cellulose-rich sheets of papyrus would readily decay, becoming covered by mould or full of holes from attacks by insects. But in dry climates, such as the Middle East, papyrus is a stable, rot-resistant writing surface. The earliest known roll of papyrus scroll was found in the tomb of an official called Hemeka near Memphis, which was then the capital city of Egypt, and is around five thousand years old. in 79CE, nearly 2,000 papyrus scrolls in the library of Julius Caesar&rsquo;s father-in-law were protected at Herculaneum by ash from the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius. However, the most famous discoveries of papyrus have come from the rubbish dumps of the ancient town of Oxyrhynchus, some 160km south-west of Cairo, in the desert to the west of the Nile. Oxyrhynchus was a regional administrative capital and for a thousand years generated vast amounts of administrative documentation, including accounts, tax returns and correspondence, which was periodically discarded to make room for more. Over time, a thick layer of sand covered these dumps, andthey were forgotten. But the documents were protected by the sand, creating a time capsule that allowed astonishing glimpses into the lives of the town&rsquo;s inhabitants over hundreds of years.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Collections of documents that record information and ideas have frequently been viewed as potentially dangerous. For thousands of years, governments, despots and conquerors have resorted to burning libraries and books to rid themselves of inconvenient evidence or obliterate cultures and ideas that they found politically, morally or religiously unacceptable. One such calamity, the burning of the Great Library of Alexandria, and the papyrus scrolls and books it contained, has been mythologized and has come to symbolize the global loss of cultural knowledge.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">D</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Besides their use in record-keeping, papyrus stems were used in many other aspects of Mediterranean life, such as for boat construction and making ropes, sails and baskets, as well as being a source of food. In 1969 the adventurer Thor Heyerdahl attempted to cross the Atlantic from Morocco in the boat Ra, to show that it was possible for mariners in ancient times to cross the Atlantic Ocean. Ra was made from bundles of papyrus stems and modelled on ancient Egyptian craft. As a marshland plant, papyrus sedge stabilizes soils and reduces erosion, while some investigations show that it has potential for water purification and sewage treatment.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">E</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;True paper was probably invented in China in the first century CE. Like papyrus, it was constructed from a meshwork of plant fibres, but the Chinese used fibres from the white mulberry tree, which yielded a tough, flexible material that could be folded, stretched, and compressed. The adoption of this paper by western cultures soon rendered papyrus obsolete.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Despite dreams of paper-free societies, western cultures still use enormous quantities of paper, often in ways that it would be inconceivable to use papyrus for. As a paper substitute, the role of the papyrus sedge in western cultures has been superseded; papyrus is little more than a niche product for the tourist market. What makes papyrus noteworthy for western societies nowadays is its use as the surface upon which our ancient ancestors recorded their lives, their art and their science. In the words of the ancient Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder, it is &lsquo;the material on which the immortality of human beings depends&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Questions 33-37<br></span><span class="c1">Choose the correct letter, A, B, C or D.<br>Write the correct letter in boxes 33-37 on your answer sheet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">33.

When we arrive and check in, we&rsquo;re always treated like old friends by the staff, so we very much feel at home. Our one disappointment during our last visit was that our room overlooked the car park, but that didn&rsquo;t spoil our stay.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">B</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The hotel hardly seems to have changed in the last hundred years, and we prefer that to many modern hotels, which tend to look the same as each other. The Wellington has character! Our room was very comfortable and quite spacious. We can strongly recommend the breakfast, though we had to wait for a table as the hotel was so full. That was a bit annoying, and there was also nowhere to sit in the lounge.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">C</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;We made our reservation by phone without problem, but when we arrived the receptionist couldn&rsquo;t see it on the computer system. Luckily there was a room available. It wasn&rsquo;t quite what we would have chosen, but it was a pleasure to sit in it with a cup of tea, and look out at the swimmers and surfers in the sea.</span></p><p class="c6 c7 c10"><span class="c1"><br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">D</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;We&rsquo;d be happy to stay at the Wellington again. Although there&rsquo;s nothing special about the rooms, the view from the lounge is lovely, and the restaurant staff were friendly and efficient. Breakfast was a highlight &ndash; there was so much on offer we could hardly decide what to eat. We&rsquo;d stay another time just for that!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">E</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The staff all did their jobs efficiently, and were very helpful when we asked for information about the area. The only difficulty we had was making our reservation online &ndash; it wasn&rsquo;t clear whether payment for our deposit went through or not, and I had to call the hotel to find out. Still, once we&rsquo;d arrived, everything went very smoothly, and we had a delicious dinner in the restaurant.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Questions 1-7<br></span><span class="c8">Look at the five online reviews of the Wellington Hotel, A-E, above.

The names make it clear what they are &ndash; two of the country&rsquo;s favourite sports where, instead of running, the players walk. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Walking football was invented in the UK in 2011, but it was a 2014 TV commercial for a bank, showing it providing financial support to someone who wanted to set up a website for the game, that brought it to people&rsquo;s attention. Since then, tens of thousands of people &mdash; mostly, though not only, over the age of 50 &mdash; have started playing, and there are more than 800 walking football clubs. Both men and women play walking football, but at the moment the netball teams consist only of women. However, men are beginning to show an interest in playing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The two games are designed to help people to be active or get fit, whatever their age and level of fitness. In particular, they were invented to encourage older men and women to get more exercise, and to give them a chance to meet other people. Regular physical activity helps to maintain energy, strength and flexibility. You can start gently and do a little more each session. The benefits include lower heart rate and blood pressure, greater mobility, less fat and more muscle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Many players have given up a sport &ndash; either through age or injury &ndash; and can now take it up again. They&rsquo;re great ways for people to enjoy a sport they used to play and love, and keep active at the same time, though people who have never played the standard game before are also very welcome.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The local councils Active Lifestyles Team runs sessions at all the council&rsquo;s leisure centres. Come alone or with a friend, and enjoy a friendly game on Monday or Saturday afternoons, or Tuesday or Thursday evenings. Each session costs &pound;3 per person, and you don&rsquo;t have to come regularly or at the same time each week. Our aim is to set up netball and football clubs as soon as there are enough regular players.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Questions 8-14<br></span><span class="c1">Do the following statements agree with the information given in the text on page 41?<br>In boxes 8-14 on your answer sheet, write</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">TRUE</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;if the statement agrees with the information<br></span><span class="c0">FALSE</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;if the statement contradicts the information<br></span><span class="c0">NOT GIVEN</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;if there is no information on this</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">8.

Your contract might also state that you need to dress &lsquo;smartly&rsquo;, rather than specifying any particular garments. As you might well have conflicting ideas of what counts as smart&rsquo;, you should ask your employer for clarification. Many employers that have a strict dress code choose to provide clothing or a discount on clothing. However, this is not necessarily compulsory for the employer and is a factor you need to consider when taking a job.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Protective clothing and equipment<br></span><span class="c1">Your employer can tell you to put on protective clothing and equipment (such as gloves, a visor, boots, etc.). If you don&rsquo;t, your employer is entitled to take disciplinary action, which can include excluding you from the workplace.<br>You are required to:<br>&bull; co-operate with your employer on health and safety<br>&bull; correctly use work items provided by your employer, including protective equipment, in accordance with instructions<br>&bull; not interfere with or misuse anything provided for your health and safety or welfare.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course, any protective gear has to fit and be appropriate for the situation. It shouldn&rsquo;t cause you pain. If it does, you should negotiate alternative equipment or arrangements. Don&rsquo;t be put off. Sometimes employers can, out of caution, interpret health and safety rules unnecessarily rigidly. And of course you shouldn&rsquo;t be required to pay for any protective equipment or clothing that you need. However, if your employer buys the gear, they are entitled to keep it when you leave.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The obligation to maintain protective clothing lies with the employer. The employer is also required to provide an appropriate storage space to keep the protective equipment in when it is not being used. And finally, the employer must provide the equipment and service free of charge to the employee.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Jewellery<br></span><span class="c1">Banning employees from wearing jewellery and loose clothing may be justified to prevent a potential hygiene hazard if you work in areas of food production or areas which need to be kept sterile.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Likewise, your employer can judge that loose jewellery may constitute a snagging hazard if you operate machinery. If you think restrictions are not justified by health and safety concerns, talk to your workplace union rep if you have one, as they may know of solutions to the problem which other employees have used before.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Questions 15-20<br></span><span class="c8">Complete the sentences below.<br>Choose </span><span class="c0">ONE WORD ONLY</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;from the text for each answer.<br>Write your answers in boxes 15-20 on your answer sheet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">15.

So how can you juggle the demands of both worlds? Below are some tips to help you get started.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s easy to get sucked into habits that, make us less efficient without realizing it &mdash; like keeping your social media page open at work so you don&rsquo;t miss something &lsquo;important&rsquo;. Draw up a list with all the activities that don&rsquo;t enhance your life or career. Then minimize the time you spend on them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s hard to say no&rsquo;, especially to a supervisor or loved one, but sometimes that powerful little word is essential. Learn to use &lsquo;no&rsquo; judiciously and it will become a powerful tool in balancing work and family.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Research shows that exercise helps you remain alert. Finding time to hit the gym may be hard, but it will ultimately help you get more things done because exercise really boosts energy and improves your ability to concentrate.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Study after study shows that significant sleep deprivation affects your health and well-being. Exposure to electronics can significantly negatively impact your sleep, so try to unplug an hour before you go to sleep.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">What would you do if you had a whole day to yourself with no demands on your time? While most people don&rsquo;t have the luxury of a whole day dedicated to relaxation, constantly putting off that downtime and putting everyone&rsquo;s needs before yours will wear you down. Pick a time to do something just for you. Even just a few minutes of &lsquo;me time&rsquo; a day will help to recharge your batteries.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t assume your family and manager are aware of your concerns. If you feel you have to adjust your schedule to discover a better work&mdash;life balance, then voice that requirement. If that means asking your boss for permission to leave a few minutes early once a week so you can hit that yoga class on the way home, do it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">All new habits require time to build, so if you find yourself sneaking your smartphone to bed, that&rsquo;s okay. Leave your phone downstairs tomorrow night. Tiny steps are the key to finding that balance, so start small, and go from there. Most of all, know your limitations and what works best for you; then decide what really matters, what advice you want to follow, and prioritize.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Questions 21-27<br></span><span class="c8">Complete the notes below.<br>Choose </span><span class="c0">ONE WORD ONLY</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;from the text for each answer.

Eventually, in 1919, officials asked the city engineer, Michael O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, to explore the possibility of building a bridge. He began to consult engineers across the USA about the feasibility of doing so, and the cost. Most doubted whether a bridge could be built at all, or estimated that it would cost $100 million. However, a Chicago-based engineer named Joseph Strauss believed he could complete the project for a modest $25 to $30 million. After his proposal was accepted, Strauss set about convincing the communities on the northern end of the strait that the bridge would be to their benefit, as well as to that of San Francisco. With population centres growing fast, there was severe traffic congestion at the ferry docks, and motor vehicle travel by ferry was fast exceeding capacity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">B</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The bridge could not be constructed without the agreement of the US War Department, which owned the land on each side of the Strait and had the power to prevent any harbour construction that might affect shipping traffic. In 1924, San Francisco and Marin counties applied for a permit to build a bridge, and after hearing overwhelming arguments in favour of the project, the Secretary of War agreed. Despite the economic benefits promised by its supporters, the project met fierce resistance from a number of businesses &ndash; particularly ferry companies &ndash; and civic leaders. Not only would the bridge be an obstacle to shipping and spoil the bay&rsquo;s natural beauty, they argued, it wouldn&rsquo;t survive the sort of earthquake that had devastated the city in 1906. Eight years of legal actions followed as opponents tried to prevent it from being built.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">C</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Meanwhile, Strauss&rsquo;s team scrapped their original plans in favour of a suspension span capable of moving more than two feet to each side: this would withstand strong wind far better than a rigid structure. They also planned the two towers, and decided on a paint colour they called &lsquo;international orange&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">D</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, Strauss and the Secretary to the Mayor of San Francisco believed a special district needed to be created, with responsibility for planning, designing and financing construction. The formation of this district would enable all the counties affected by the bridge to have a say in the proceedings. This happened in 1928, when the California legislature passed an act to establish the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District, consisting of six counties. In 1930, residents voted on the question of whether to put up their homes, their farms and their business properties as security for a $35 million bond issue to finance construction. The outcome was a large majority in favour.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, the District struggled to find a financial backer amid the difficulties of the Great Depression, a problem made worse by years of expensive legal proceedings. Now desperate, Strauss personally sought help from the President of Bank of America, who provided a crucial boost by agreeing to buy $6 million in bonds in 1932.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">E</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Construction began in January 1933, with the excavation of a vast amount of rock to establish the bridge&rsquo;s two anchorages &ndash; the structures in the ground that would take the tension from the suspension cables. The crew consisted of virtually anyone capable of withstanding the physical rigours of the job, as out-of-work cab drivers, farmers and clerks lined up for the chance to earn steady wages as ironworkers and cement mixers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The attempt to build what would be the first bridge support in the open ocean proved an immense challenge. Working from a long framework built out from the San Francisco side, divers plunged to depths of 90 feet through strong currents to blast away rock and remove the debris. The framework was damaged when it was struck by a ship in August 1933 and again during a powerful storm later in the year, setting construction back five months.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">F</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The two towers were completed in June 1935, and a New Jersey-based company was appointed to handle the on-site construction of the suspension cables. Its engineers had mastered a technique in which individual steel wires were banded together in spools and carried across the length of the bridge on spinning wheels. Given a year to complete the task, they instead finished in just over six months, having spun more than 25,000 individual wires into each massive cable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The roadway was completed in April 1937, and the bridge officially opened to pedestrians the following month. The next day, President Roosevelt announced its opening via White House telegraph.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">G</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Golden Gate has endured as a marvel of modern engineering; its main span was the longest in the world for a suspension bridge until 1981, while its towers made it the tallest bridge of any type until 1993. It withstood a destructive earthquake in 1989 and was closed to traffic only three times in its first 75 years due to weather conditions. Believed to be the most, photographed bridge in the world, this landmark was named one of the seven civil engineering wonders of the United States by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1994.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Questions 28-35<br></span><span class="c1">The text above has seven sections, A-G.<br>Which section mentions the following?<br>Write the correct letter, A-G, in boxes 28-35 on your answer sheet.

For example, your activities may be recorded on CCTV cameras, and your letters may be opened and read. In addition, your employer may use an automated software programme to check the emails you receive at work. Phone calls may be listened to and recorded, and the log of websites you use may be checked.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">All of these forms of monitoring are covered by data protection law. Data protection law doesn&rsquo;t prevent monitoring in the workplace. However, it does set down rules about the circumstances and the way in which monitoring should be carried out.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Before deciding whether to introduce monitoring, your employer should identify any negative effects the monitoring may have on staff. This is called impact assessment.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1"><br><br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Monitoring electronic communications at work<br></span><span class="c1">Your employer can legally monitor your use of electronic communications in the workplace if the monitoring relates to the business and the equipment being monitored is provided partly or wholly for work.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Except in extremely limited circumstances, employers must take reasonable steps to let staff know that monitoring is happening, what is being monitored and why it is necessary.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As long as your employer sticks to these rules, they don&rsquo;t need to get your consent before they monitor your electronic communications, but only if the monitoring is for specific reasons. These may be to establish facts which are relevant to the business or to check standards, for example, listening in to phone calls to assess the quality of your work. Monitoring is also allowed if its purpose is to prevent or detect crime. It may be necessary to make sure electronic systems are operating effectively, for example, to prevent computer viruses entering the system. Your employer is also allowed to listen in to any calls you make to confidential helplines, but in this case he or she is not allowed to record these calls.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Questions 15-21<br></span><span class="c8">Complete the notes below.

And now efforts to develop fanning there are bringing a significant health concern. Professor James Wood from the University of Cambridge explains that new breeds that are being introduced are more vulnerable to bovine TB (tuberculosis) than the zebu cattle which were previously reared there. &lsquo;This may have health implications for those who work with and live alongside infected cattle, and also raises concerns about transmission to areas which previously had low levels of TB,&rsquo; he warns.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Wood leads a research programme which is looking at the feasibility of control strategies, including cattle vaccination. The programme brings together veterinary scientists, epidemiologists, geneticists, immunologists and social scientists in eight Ethiopian and UK institutions. &lsquo;We need this mix because we are not only asking how effective strategies will be, but also whether farmers will accept them, and what the consequences are for prosperity and wellbeing,&rsquo; says Wood.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The impact that increasing productivity can have on farmers&rsquo; livelihoods is not lost on an insect expert at the University of Ghana, Dr Ken Fening, who is working on another food-related research project. Cabbages are not indigenous to Africa but have become a major cash crop for Ghanaian farmers and an important source of income for traders from markets and hotels. &lsquo;A good crop can bring in money to buy fertilisers and farm equipment, and also help to pay for healthcare and education for the family,&rsquo; he says. Recently, however, fields of stunted, yellowing cabbages, their leaves curled and dotted with mould, have become a familiar and devastating sight for the farmers of Ghana.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">From his field station base in Kpong, Ghana, Fening works closely with smallholder farmers on pest-control strategies. Two years ago they started reporting that a new disease was attacking their crops. &lsquo;It seemed to be associated with massive infestations of pink and green aphids,&rsquo; says Fening, &lsquo;and from my studies of the way insects interact with many different vegetables, I&rsquo;m familial* with the types of damage they can cause.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But farmers were typically seeing the total loss of their crops, and he realised that the devastation couldn&rsquo;t just be caused by sap-sucking insects. Despite no previous reports of viral diseases affecting cabbage crops in Ghana, the symptoms suggested a viral pathogen.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Together with Cambridge plant biologist Dr John Carr, Fening collected samples of cabbage plants in Ghana showing signs of disease, and also aphids on the diseased plants. Back in Cambridge, Fening used screening techniques including a type of DNA &lsquo;fingerprinting&rsquo; to identify the aphid species, and sophisticated molecular biology methods to try to identify the offending virus.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Aphids are a common carrier of plant-infecting viruses,&rsquo; explains Carr. &lsquo;The &ldquo;usual suspects&rdquo; are turnip mosaic virus and cauliflower mosaic virus, which affect cabbages in Europe and the US.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&lsquo;We found that two different species of aphids, pink and green, were generally found on the diseased cabbages,&rsquo; says Fening. &lsquo;It turned out this was the first record of the green aphid species ever being seen in Ghana.&rsquo; The pink aphid was identified as Myzus persicae (Sulzer).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s more, the virus was not what they expected, and work is now ongoing to identify the culprit. The sooner it can be characterised, the sooner sustainable crop protection strategies can be developed to prevent further spread of the disease not only in Ghana, but also in other countries in the region. Another researcher who hopes that eradication strategies will be the outcome of her research project is Dr Theresa Manful. Like Fening, she is a researcher at the University of Ghana. She has been working with Cambridge biochemist Professor Mark Carrington on a disease known as trypanosomiasis.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&lsquo;This is a major constraint to cattle fearing in Africa,&rsquo; she explains. &lsquo;Although trypanosomiasis is also a disease of humans, the number of cases is low, and the more serious concerns about the disease relate to the economic impact on agricultural production.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The parasite that causes the disease is carried by the tsetse fly, which colonises vast swathes of sub-Saharan Africa. Carrington says that a lot is now known about the parasite&rsquo;s molecular mechanisms, in particular the way it evades the immune system of the animal acting as its host by altering the proteins in its coat so as to remain &lsquo;invisible&rsquo;. &lsquo;But then when you look at the effect on large animals, you realise that there is almost nothing known about the dynamics of an infection, and even whether an infection acquired at an early age persists for its lifetime,&rsquo; he says. So Manful and Carrington set about testing cattle in Ghana. They discovered that nearly all were infected most of the time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">For Manful, one of the important gains has been the ability to expand the research in Ghana: &lsquo;I now have a fully functional lab and can do DNA extraction and analysis in Ghana -1 don&rsquo;t have to bring samples to Cambridge. We are teaching students from five Ghanaian institutions the diagnostic methods.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Agriculture faces increasing challenges,&rsquo; adds Carr. &lsquo;Bioscience is playing a crucial part in developing ways to mitigate pest impact and reduce the spread of parasites. We want to ensure not only that every harvest is successful, but also that it&rsquo;s maximally successful.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Questions 28-32<br></span><span class="c1">Choose the correct letter, A, B, C or D.<br>Write the correct letter in boxes 28-32 on your answer sheet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">28.

The type of delay you can claim for depends on whether the train company runs a Delay Repay scheme or a less generous, older-style scheme.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Delay Repay is a train operator scheme to compensate passengers when trains are late, and the train company will pay out even if it was not responsible for the delay. The scheme varies between companies, but up to 2016 most paid 50 percent of the single ticket cost for 30 minutes&rsquo; delay and 100 percent for an hour. On the London Underground, you get a full refund for 15-minute delays.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Companies that do not use Delay Repay and still use the older scheme will not usually pay compensation if the problem is considered to be out of their control. But it is still worth asking them for compensation, as some may pay out. You are unlikely to get compensation for a delay if any of the following occur:<br>&bull; Accidents involving people getting onto the line illegally<br>&bull; Gas leaks or fires in buildings next to the line which were not caused by a train company<br>&bull; Line closures at the request of the emergency services<br>&bull; Exceptionally severe weather conditions<br>&bull; Strike action</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">National Rail Conditions of Travel state that you are entitled to compensation in the same form that you paid for the ticket. Some train companies are still paying using rail vouchers, which they are allowed to do if you do not ask for a cash refund.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Since 2016, rail passengers have acquired further rights for compensation through the Consumer Rights Act. This means that passengers could now be eligible for compensation due to: a severely overcrowded train with too few carriages available; a consistently late running service; and a service that is delayed for less than the time limit that applied under existing compensation schemes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, in order to exercise their rights beyond the existing compensation schemes, for instance Delay Repay, and where the train operating company refuses to compensate despite letters threatening court action, passengers may need to bring their claims to a court of law.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Questions 9-14<br></span><span class="c1">Do the following statements agree with the information given in the text on page 86?<br>In boxes 9-14 on your answer sheet, write</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">TRUE</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;if the statement agrees with the information<br></span><span class="c0">FALSE</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;if the statement contradicts the information<br></span><span class="c0">NOT GIVEN</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;if there is no information on this</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">9. The system for claiming compensation varies from one company to another.<br>10. Under Delay Repay, a train company will only provide compensation if it caused the delay.<br>11. Under Delay Repay, underground and other train companies give exactly the same amounts of money in compensation.<br>12. An increasing number of train companies are willing to pay compensation for problems they are not responsible for.<br>13. It is doubtful whether companies using the older scheme will provide compensation if a delay is caused by a strike.<br>14. Passengers may receive compensation in the form of a train voucher if they forget to request cash.</span></p><p class="c6 c7 c10"><span class="c1"><br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">SECTION 2: Questions 15-27<br></span><span class="c1">Read the text below and answer Questions 15-19.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13 c0">Vacancy for food preparation assistant</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Durrant House pic runs restaurants and cafes as concessions in airports, train stations and other busy environments around the country.

A partnership is the easier way to get started, and simply links two or more people together in a simple business structure. Unlike a limited company, a partnership doesn&rsquo;t have a separate legal status. The partners are usually self-employed individuals, although a limited company counts as a &lsquo;legal person&rsquo; and can also be a partner.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In a partnership, you and your partner or partners personally share responsibility for your business. This means, among other things, that if your business cannot afford to pay its debts, you must pay them yourselves. Again, this is not the case with a limited company. Partners share the business&rsquo;s profits, and each partner pays tax on their share.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When you set up a business partnership you need to choose a name. You can trade under your own names, for example, &lsquo;Smith and Jones&rsquo;, or you can choose another name for your business. You don&rsquo;t need to register your name. However, you should register your name as a trademark if you want to stop people from trading under your business name.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Business partnership names must not include &lsquo;limited&rsquo;, &lsquo;Ltd&rsquo;, &lsquo;limited liability partnership&rsquo;, &lsquo;LLP&rsquo;, &lsquo;public limited company&rsquo; or &lsquo;pic&rsquo;, be offensive, or be the same as an existing trademark. Your name also can&rsquo;t suggest a connection with government or local authorities, unless you get permission. There is no central database of partnership names in the UK, so to avoid using the same name as another business, it is advisable to search on the internet for the name you are considering.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You must include all the partners&rsquo; names and the business name (if you have one) on official paperwork, for example invoices. You must choose a &lsquo;nominated partner&rsquo; who is responsible for registering your partnership with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the government department responsible for the collection of taxes. This person is responsible for managing the partnership&rsquo;s tax returns and keeping business records. Alternatively, you can appoint an agent to deal with HMRC on your behalf.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">All partners need to register with HMRC separately and send their own tax returns as individuals. You must register by 5 October in your business&rsquo;s second tax year, or you could be charged a penalty. You must also register for VAT if your VAT taxable turnover is more than &pound;85,000. You can choose to register if it&rsquo;s below this, for example to reclaim VAT on business supplies.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Questions 20-27<br></span><span class="c8">Complete the sentences below.

Administered by the Motor Services Department of the Post Office, it carries over 120 million passengers each year and is carefully integrated with other public transport services: trains, boats and mountain cableways. The Swiss transportation system resembles a tree, with the larger branches representing federal and private railways, the smaller branches being the coaches, and the twigs being the urban transit operators running trams, city buses, boats, chairlifts and so on. But the trunk that holds the tree together is the vast postbus network, without which the whole network would not function.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There isn&rsquo;t an inhabited place in Switzerland that cannot be reached by some sort of public transport. Federal law and the Swiss Constitution stipulate that every village with a population greater than 40 is entitled to regular bus services. The frequency of these services is directly related to population density. Timetables are put together four years in advance, and seldom change. If a new route is to be introduced, the population of the area affected is invited to vote in a referendum.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">At times, postbuses are the main &mdash; sometimes the only &mdash; links between settlements. These coaches, often with a trailer in tow to increase their capacity, are a common sight in high-altitude regions, and their signature sound &mdash; part of Rossini&rsquo;s William Tell Overturn, played by the drivers on three-tone post horns with electrical compressors at every road turn &mdash; is one of the most familiar Swiss sounds.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The three-tone horns can still be used to &lsquo;talk&rsquo; to post offices (and each other) from a distance. By altering the combination of the tones, a driver can announce &lsquo;departure of post1, &lsquo;arrival of post&rsquo;, &lsquo;arrival of special post&rsquo;, and so on &ndash; so much more romantic and often more reliable than radio or mobile phones. This musical &lsquo;language&rsquo; started in the mid-nineteenth century, when the coach drivers could also blow their horns a certain number of times on approaching the station to indicate the number of horses needing to be fed, giving the stationmaster time to prepare the fodder.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The postbus history goes back to 1849, when the Swiss postal service was made a monopoly. The role of today&rsquo;s modern yellow buses was, back then, played by horse-drawn carriages (or in winter by sleighs, in order to travel on snow), which were the same colour. By 1914, eight years after the first motor coaches were introduced, there were still 2,500 horses, 2,231 coaches (or carriages) and 1,059 sleighs in service.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">After the First World War, Swiss Post bought a fleet of decommissioned military trucks which were converted into postbuses, but it was not until 1961 that the last horse-drawn coach was replaced with a motorised version.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Today, the Swiss Post Office boasts one of the worlds most advanced coach fleets, including fuel-cell models and the world&rsquo;s first driverless bus. This was launched in 2015 in the town of Sion, the capital of the canton of Valais, one of the 26 cantons, or administrative regions, that make up the country.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Postbuses often go to places that other means of transport cannot reach. Most of the drivers therefore see themselves as educators and tour guides. Although it&rsquo;s not in their job description, they&rsquo;re likely to point out the sights &mdash; waterfalls, gorges, and so on &mdash; and are always ready to pull over for a photo opportunity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Switzerland&rsquo;s longest postbus journey, and one of the highest, crosses four mountain passes &ndash; an eight-hour trip undertaken by a single postbus. The route goes through several cantons; two languages (German and Italian); all four seasons &ndash; from burning sunshine to showers and heavy snowfalls; and countless places of interest, One of the passes, the Gotthard, is often described as &lsquo;the People&rsquo;s Road&rsquo;, probably because it connects the German-speaking canton of Uri with Italian-speaking Ticino. Like Switzerland itself, postbuses &lsquo;speak&rsquo; all four state languages: German, French, Italian and Romansh &ndash; and by law, their automated intercom announcements are given in the language of whichever canton the bus is currently passing through.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Irrespective of their previous driving experience, drivers undergo lots of training. During the first year, they have, to drive postbuses under the supervision of a more experienced driver. Only after two years of safe driving in the valleys can they be pronounced ready for a mountain bus.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some routes are not at all busy, with the bus often carrying just two or three passengers at a time. But for most people living in small mountain villages, the postbus is of the utmost importance. It not only carries the villagers to town and back, it takes village children to and from school, delivers mail, transports milk from the village farms down to the valley, collects rubbish from the village (Swiss laws do not allow dumping anywhere in the mountains), and brings building materials to households. It takes elderly villagers to shops and carries their shopping up the hill to their homes. More a friend than just a means of transportation, for the dwellers of mountain villages the postbus is an essential part of life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Questions 28-32<br></span><span class="c1">Choose the correct letter, A, B, C or D.<br>Write the correct letter in boxes 28-32 on your answer sheet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">28.
