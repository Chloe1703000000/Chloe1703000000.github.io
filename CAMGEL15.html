It has a separate glass lid, and the handle on the lid stays cool. It produces perfectly cooked white rice, but tends to spit when cooking brown rice. There are slight dirt traps around the rim of the lid, and neither the pot nor the lid is dishwasher safe.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">B Family Rice Cooker<br></span><span class="c0">This has a plastic exterior and a flip-top lid. The lid locks when closed and becomes a secure handle to carry the cooker. The aluminium interior pot is quite difficult to clean, and it can&rsquo;t be put in a dishwasher. It&rsquo;s programmed to adjust the temperature once the rice is done so that it stops cooking but doesn&rsquo;t get cold.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">C Mini Rice Cooker<br></span><span class="c0">This has a flip-top lid and a 0.3 litre capacity. The interior pot is made of non-stick aluminium and is dishwasher safe. This rice cooker is ideal when cooking for one.

Preventing falls from roofs is a priority for WorkSafe New Zealand. Investigations by WorkSafe into falls that occur while working at height show that more than 50 percent of falls are from under three metres, and most of these are from ladders and roofs. The cost of these falls is estimated to be $24 million a year &ndash; to say nothing of the human costs that result from these falls. More injuries happen on residential building sites than any other workplace in the construction sector.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In order to prevent such injuries, a hazard assessment should be carried out for all work on roofs to assess potential dangers. It is essential that the hazards are identified before the work starts, and that the necessary equipment, appropriate precautions and systems of work are provided and implemented. Hazard identification should be repeated periodically or when there is a change in conditions, for example, the weather or numbers of staff onsite.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The first thing to be considered is whether it is possible to eliminate this hazard completely, so that workers are not exposed to the danger of falling. This can sometimes be done at the design, construction planning, and tendering stage. If the possibility of a fail cannot be eliminated, some form of edge protection should be used to prevent workers from falling. It may be possible to use the existing scaffolding as edge protection. If this is not practicable, then temporary work platforms should be used. In cases where such protection is not possible, then steps should be taken to minimise the likelihood of any harm resulting. This means considering the use of safety nets and other similar systems to make it less likely that injury will be caused if a fall does occur.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ladders should only be employed for short-duration maintenance work such as touching up paint. People using ladders should be trained and instructed in the selection and safe use of ladders. There should be inspection of all ladders on a regular basis to ensure they are safe to use.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Questions 15-22<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the notes below.

At the time, Marshall was working to build a water-powered sawmill for businessman John Sutter. As it happens, just days after Marshall&rsquo;s discovery, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed, ending the Mexican-American War and transferring California, with its mineral deposits, into the ownership of the United States. At the time, the population of the territory consisted of 6,500 Californios {people of Spanish or Mexican descent); 700 foreigners (primarily Americans); and 150,000 Native Americans.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">B</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Though Marshall and Sutter tried to keep news of the discovery quiet, word got out, and by mid-March 1848 at least one newspaper was reporting that large quantities of gold were being found. Though the initial reaction in San Francisco was disbelief, storekeeper Sam Brannan set off a frenzy when he paraded through town displaying a small bottle containing gold from Sutter&rsquo;s Creek. By mid-June, some three-quarters of the male population of San Francisco had left town for the gold mines, and the number of miners in the area reached 4,000 by August.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">C</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;As news spread of the fortunes being made in California, the first migrants to arrive were those from lands accessible by boat, such as Oregon, the Sandwich Islands {now Hawaii), Mexico, Chile, Peru and even China. Only later would the news reach the East Coast, where press reports were initially skeptical. Throughout 1849, thousands of people around the United States (mostly men) borrowed money, mortgaged their property or spent their life savings to make the arduous journey to California. In pursuit of the kind of wealth they had never dreamed of, they left their families and local areas; in turn, their wives had no option but to shoulder different responsibilities such as running farms or businesses, and many made a real success of them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By the end of the year, the non-native population of California was estimated at 100,000 {as compared with 20,000 at the end of 1848 and around 800 in March 1848). To accommodate the needs of the &rsquo;49ers, as the gold miners were known, towns had sprung up all over the region, complete with shops and other businesses seeking to make their own Gold Rush fortune. The overcrowded chaos of the mining camps and towns grew ever more lawless. San Francisco, for its part, developed a bustling economy and became the central metropolis of the new frontier.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">D</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;How did all these would-be miners search for gold? Panning was the oldest way. The basic procedure was to place some gold-bearing materials, such as river gravel, into a shallow pan, add some water, and then carefully swirl the mixture around so the water and light material spilled over the side. If all went well, the heavier gold nuggets or gold dust would settle to the bottom of the pan. Gold panning was slow even for the most skillful miner. On a good day, one miner could wash about 50 pans in the usual 12-hour workday.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">E</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Another way was to use what was called a &lsquo;rocker&rsquo;. Isaac Humphrey is said to have introduced it to the California gold fields. It was simply a rectangular wooden box, set at a downward angle and mounted on a rocking mechanism. The dirt and rock was dumped into the top, followed by a bucket of water. The box was rocked by hand to agitate the mixture. The big rocks were caught in a sieve at the top, the waste exited the lower end with the water, and the heavy gold fell to the bottom of the box.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The rocker had advantages and disadvantages. The advantages were that it was easily transportable; it did not require a constant source of water; and, most importantly, a miner could process more dirt and rock than with a pan. The primary disadvantage was that the rocker had difficulty in trapping the smallest particles of gold, commonly known as &lsquo;flour&rsquo;. Some miners added small amounts of mercury to the bottom of the rocker. Due to its chemical composition, it had a facility to trap fine gold. Periodically, the miners would remove and heat it. As it vaporized, it would leave gold behind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">F</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;After 1850, the surface gold in California had largely disappeared, even as miners continued to reach the gold fields. Mining had always been difficult and dangerous labor, and striking it rich required good luck as much as skill and hard work. Moreover, the average daily pay for an independent miner had by then dropped sharply from what it had been in 1848. As gold became more and more difficult to reach, the growing industrialization of mining drove more and more miners from independence into wage labor. The new technique of hydraulic mining, developed in 1853, brought enormous profits, but destroyed much of the region&rsquo;s landscape.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">G</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Though gold mining continued throughout the 1850s, it had reached its peak by 1852, when gold worth some $81 million was pulled from the ground. After that year, the total take declined gradually, leveling off to around $45 million per year by 1857.

It&rsquo;s the nature of the job, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should be complacent about it. According to Safe Work Australia, communicable diseases from work-related exposures to biological hazards such as sewage have been estimated to cause 320,000 deaths across the globe each year. In addition to this, plumbers are regularly exposed to other biohazards such as mould, bacteria and algae. Don&rsquo;t risk it &ndash; make sure appropriate protective clothing and equipment is used.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Confined spaces<br></span><span class="c0">Plumbers may spend much of their time working in confined spaces, where they are at risk from contaminants, including airborne gases, vapours and dusts, that may cause injury from fire or explosion. They may also be exposed to high concentrations of airborne contaminants that may be harmful to health. For example, one plumber was fined $220,000 after an employee suffered from carbon-monoxide poisoning. Another potential hazard for plumbers in confined spaces is that of drowning, if water sources are not adequately cut off. The Safe Work Australia confined spaces code of practice outlines the necessary steps and precautions for avoiding illness and injury.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Electricity<br></span><span class="c0">The Master Plumbers&rsquo; Association calls electricity &lsquo;plumbing&rsquo;s hidden killer&rsquo;. Metal pipes are often conductive and so gloves which provide insulation should form part of a plumber&rsquo;s tool kit, as should a plumbing voltage monitor and a volt tester. Gloves should be checked prior to every use and replaced every 12 to 14 months. Electrical equipment like bridging conductors should be regularly checked, with appropriate tags on the equipment to verify its safety. The project should be stopped immediately if there is any sign of electricity, so that the power can be disconnected by a qualified electrician prior to continuing work.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Questions 15-20<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the table below.

It does, however, require careful management.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When it comes to implementing flexible working one word is key: trust. All flexible workers should be trusted and given well-defined objectives from the start and their contribution should be assessed according to their output, as opposed to the time they spend on the job. It can be a big step to implement such a change in your business, so if you are slightly cautious then I recommend perhaps setting up an end-of-the-day review to see how much progress has been made. As all parties find their feet with the new set-up, this contact can slowly be reduced.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In my eyes, it is also vital that there is shared calendar access for everyone so that people can see where their colleagues are each day. This way if they need to catch up with someone they can plan when to do so. Technology now exists to enable employees to stay in touch with other members of staff and external partners. iMeet, for example, is a tool which allows all forms of collaboration for remote working, from video conferencing, live chat and file sharing to screen sharing. The new breed of worker is therefore fully equipped to work productively away from the office, and can still feel like they are in the same room as others when necessary.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In my experience, employees are often more productive working at home as they can work the exact hours they want and do not have to cope with distraction caused by other employees. Being outside the confines of the office walls also appears to foster creativity. In addition, we find staff are more motivated as they have a better work-life balance. In terms of the business, we find this helps with top talent recruitment and staff retention, and a happy workforce is a more successful one.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Questions 21-27<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the notes below.

However, as human populations exploded and as sea turtles began to confront additional threats such as intensive fishing, beach development and climate change, sea turtle populations declined precipitously. Today, all but one of the world&rsquo;s seven species of sea turtles are considered threatened according to the IUCN* Red List. And the one that&rsquo;s not &ndash; the flatback turtle &ndash; is listed as data deficient, which means scientists simply don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s doing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">B</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;One major problem is that every year millions of sea turtle eggs are illegally taken by poachers for sale on the black market. The situation is particularly serious in Nicaragua, in Central America, which is home to four sea turtle species.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kim Williams-Guillen, who works for conservation body Paso Pacifico, described the poaching of sea turtle nests on the beaches of Nicaragua as &lsquo;uncontrolled, unregulated, extensive and contested&rsquo;. Even the best-protected beaches are plundered to some extent and it&rsquo;s not uncommon to see poachers digging up nests just meters from tourists watching sea turtles laying their clutch at night, she said. This poaching becomes particularly frenzied during the arribadas &ndash; mass laying events where thousands of turtles nest on the same beach for a single night in a biological strategy to overwhelm natural predators.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">C</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&lsquo;Even with armed guards, the numbers of poachers overwhelm military personnel by ten or twenty to one,&rsquo; Williams-Guillen said. &lsquo;Although many poachers are locals with limited resources, during these arribadas there are influxes of gangs of poachers from larger cities outside local communities. These are not just local poor people without other options.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But to protect the country&rsquo;s sea turtles, Williams-Guillen said conservationists shouldn&rsquo;t just depend on catching low-level operators. &lsquo;If one poacher decides to stop, another one will just step into his place &hellip; we need to know more about the middlemen and people higher up in the distribution chain,&rsquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">D</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Paso Pacifico&rsquo;s solution is the creation of high-tech sea turtle eggs: fake eggs convincingly crafted to look like the real thing, but which contain GPS tracking devices. These have the potential to reveal the destination markets for trafficked sea turtle eggs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Making convincing sea turtle eggs is not easy, and Paso Pacifico is still working on perfecting a prototype. In particular, it&rsquo;s proving quite problematic to create the right texture, since sea turtle eggs are not covered in a hard shell like those of birds, but are quite flexible.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So Paso Pacifico brought in Lauren Wilde, a special effects artist in the US, to create a convincing outer shell. First, Wilde had to get her hands on the real thing. Since it&rsquo;s illegal to send sea turtle eggs over the border, Wilde is using land turtle eggs from California. &lsquo;It was really eye opening and important for me to feel these eggs and how the shell bends a little,&rsquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To get the GPS device inside the shell, Paso Pacifico is using 3D printers to make a plastic ball which will then have a GPS transmitter fitted inside. This will take the place of the embryo inside the shell. Lastly the fake shells will be sealed with silicone, waterproofing them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">E</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Sea turtles on average lay around 100 eggs in a nest, and once the fake eggs are finished they will be slipped in with the real ones. Williams-Guilien said it might even be possible to deliver fake eggs into nests while poachers are at work. Wary of tourists, poachers will often back off if strangers come near and then return when they have gone. &lsquo;It would be pretty easy to drop an egg in the dark into a nest they have been digging up,&rsquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Once the poacher picks up the fake egg along with the real ones, conservationists and law enforcement agents will be able to track them. Experts believe most of the stolen eggs eventually make their way out of Nicaragua, possibly to El Salvador or Guatemala. However, there is also growing concern that sea turtle eggs from Central America are actually heading to the USA, from where they are sold on to other countries around the world.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">F</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;To date, Paso Pacifico has yet to put a single fake egg in a nest. But Williams- Guilien said she isn&rsquo;t too concerned that publicity for their scheme will result in poachers looking for the eggs. The vast majority of the poaching is happening at night, so already it is hard to tell [the eggs] apart, and at this point, poachers and middlemen are not closely inspecting eggs, but rather shoving them into a sack as quickly as possible.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, poachers will eventually become aware of the prospect of fake eggs among the real ones &ndash; especially when customers try to bite into an egg and break their teeth on the GPS transmitter instead. So, Paso Pacifico plans to do a massive deployment of as many fakes as possible to gather a lot of data before poachers get wise.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Knowing where the eggs go will allow conservationists and law enforcement agents to focus their resources on the right places &ndash; whether it be through awareness-building campaigns or crackdowns on illegal sellers. And eventually Paso Pacifico hopes to share the technology with interested parties around the world.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Questions 28-33<br></span><span class="c0">The text has six sections, A-F.

So make sure you pick the right keyboard for your needs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">A Logitech K120<br></span><span class="c0">Logitech&rsquo;s K120 offers a number of extra features, it&rsquo;s spill-resistant, draining small amounts of liquid if you have an accident. It isn&rsquo;t particularly eye-catching, but it feels very solid. For the price, it&rsquo;s a tempting choice.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">B Cherry MX 3.0 Keyboard<br></span><span class="c0">The Cherry MX 3.0 looks simple and neat, thanks to its compact build. It&rsquo;s solid, durable and you don&rsquo;t need to push keys all the way down to activate them. It&rsquo;s also rather loud though, which can take some getting used to.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">C Logitech K780<br></span><span class="c0">The K780 is a compact, pleasantly modern-looking keyboard. There&rsquo;s an integrated stand for smartphones and tablets too. It&rsquo;s quiet to type on, and the circular keys are easy to familiarise yourself with, well-spaced and large enough to hit accurately. For this price though, the lack of backlighting is disappointing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">D Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic<br></span><span class="c0">The Sculpt&rsquo;s curved, strange-looking build serves a purpose, it provides wrist support and lifts your forearms into a relaxed position so you don&rsquo;t hurt yourself from typing for lengthy periods.

It has generously sized keys, though the two-piece spacebar takes some getting used to. Another useful feature is that you can get up to three months&rsquo; use from a single charge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">F Corsair Strafe RGB Keyboard<br></span><span class="c0">Corsair&rsquo;s keyboard is expensive, flashy and extremely impressive.

However, working for a small or medium-sized business has many advantages that are too easily overlooked. Here are just a few of them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Working in a small organisation with a small workforce means it&rsquo;s likely to be easy to become part of it. it won&rsquo;t be long before you&rsquo;re familiar with the staff and the departments that you need to deal with. This can provide a feeling of comfort that takes much longer to develop in a large company. Departments are likely to be small and have close connections with each other, which helps to make internal communication work well &ndash; everyone knows what&rsquo;s going on. You&rsquo;ll also gain a better understanding of how your own role fits into the company as a whole.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In a small business you&rsquo;re likely to have considerable variety in your workload, including opportunities to work in different areas of the company, which will allow you to identify abilities that you didn&rsquo;t know you had. An introduction to new activities could even lead to a change of career. This variety in your work will help to make it stimulating, so you have a good reason for getting out of bed in the morning.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There will be plenty of opportunities to show initiative, and you&rsquo;ll also learn to function well as part of a team. Because it&rsquo;s much harder to overlook someone within a small workforce than a large one, your efforts are more likely to attract the attention of those higher up. You&rsquo;ll have plenty of opportunity to show what you can do, and to have your potential noticed. The result is very likely to be that promotion comes to you faster.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Small businesses are usually flexible, something that is rarely true of large organisations. This means that if they&rsquo;re well managed, they can adapt to make the most of changes in the wider economy, which in turn can help you. Don&rsquo;t dismiss them as a place to work because of the myths about them. Small firms can be ideal places for developing your career.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Questions 15-20<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the sentences below.

If the route from home is unfamiliar to you, make a practice run first the normal first activity in a new job is a meeting with your boss, and it would be embarrassing to be late. Dress formally until you&rsquo;re sure of the dress code.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">B</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You should expect to have an induction programme planned for you; a security pass; visits to whatever parts of the organisation you need to understand to do your job properly; meetings with anyone who could affect your success in the role; and someone to show you where everything is and tell you all the real rules of the culture &ndash; the ones that are never written down but which everyone is meant to follow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">C</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It can be a shock to join a new organisation. When you are a newcomer, feeling uncertain and perhaps a little confused, there can be a strong temptation to talk about your old job and organisation as a way of reminding yourself and telling others that you really know what you are doing, because you did it in your previous role. Unfortunately, this will suggest that you have a high opinion of yourself, and that you think your old place was better. It has enormous power to annoy, so don&rsquo;t do it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">D</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;All employers have a core product or service paid for by customers which justifies their existence. If you are not part of this core activity, remember that your role is to provide a service to the people who are part of it. Understanding their concerns and passions is essential for understanding why your own role exists, and for knowing how to work alongside these colleagues. This is why you must see this product or service in action.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">E</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;When I worked for a television company, all of us, whatever our job, were strongly encouraged to visit a studio and see how programmes were made.

But no matter how well they have stuck to their training regime, contestants will find that running non-stop for 42 kilometres is going to hurt.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now consider the barnacle goose. Every year this bird carries out a 3000-kilometre migration. So how do the birds prepare for this? Do they spend months gradually building up fitness? That&rsquo;s not really the barnacle goose&rsquo;s style. Instead, says environmental physiologist Lewis Halsey, &lsquo;They just basically sit on the water and eat a lot.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Until recently, nobody had really asked whether exercise is as tightly connected to fitness in the rest of the animal kingdom as it is for us. The question is tied up in a broader assumption: that animals maintain fitness because of the exercise they get finding food and escaping predators.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Halsey points out that this may not necessarily be the case. Take the house cat. Most domestic cats spend much of the day lounging around, apparently doing nothing, rather than hunting for food. But over short distances, even the laziest can move incredibly fast when they want to. Similarly, black and brown bears manage to come out of several months&rsquo; hibernation with their muscle mass intact &ndash; without having to lift so much as a paw during this time.<br>Barnacle geese go one better. In the process of sitting around, they don&rsquo;t just maintain their fitness. They also develop stronger hearts and bigger flight muscles, enabling them to fly for thousands of kilometres in a migration that may last as little as two days.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, if exercise isn&rsquo;t necessarily the key to physical strength, then what is? One clue comes from a broader view of the meaning of physical fitness. Biologically speaking, all it means is that the body has undergone changes that make it stronger and more efficient. In animals such as bears these changes appear to be triggered by cues such as falling temperatures or insufficient food. In the months of hibernation, these factors seem to prompt the release of muscle-protecting compounds which are then carried to the bears&rsquo; muscles in their blood and prevent muscle loss.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Barnacle geese, Halsey suggests, may be responding to an environmental change such as temperature, which helps their bodies somehow &lsquo;know&rsquo; that a big physical challenge is looming. In other bird species, that cue may be something different. Chris Guglielmo, a physiological ecologist, has studied the effect of subjecting migratory songbirds known as yellow-rumped warblers to changing hours of daylight. &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t need to take little songbirds and train them up to do a 6- or 10-hour flight,&rsquo; he says. If they are subjected to the right daylight cycle, &lsquo;we can take them out of the cage and put them in the wind tunnel, and they fly for 10 hours.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unlike migratory birds, however, humans have no biological shortcut to getting fit. Instead, pressures in our evolutionary history made our bodies tie fitness to exercise.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Our ancestors&rsquo; lives were unpredictable. They had to do a lot of running to catch food and escape danger, but they also needed to keep muscle mass to a minimum because muscle is biologically expensive. Each kilogram contributes about 10 to 15 kilocalories a day to our metabolism when resting &mdash; which doesn&rsquo;t sound like much until you realise that muscles account for about 40 percent of the average person&rsquo;s body mass. &lsquo;Most of us are spending 20 percent of our basic energy budget taking care of muscle mass,&rsquo; says Daniel Lieberman, an evolutionary biologist and marathon runner.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So our physiology evolved to let our weight and fitness fluctuate depending on how much food was available. &lsquo;This makes us evolutionarily different from most other animals,&rsquo; says Lieberman. In general, animals merely need to be capable of short bouts of intense activity, whether it&rsquo;s the cheetah chasing prey or the gazelle escaping. Cats are fast, but they don&rsquo;t need to run very far. Perhaps a few mad dashes around the house are all it takes to keep a domestic one fit enough for feline purposes. &lsquo;Humans, on the other hand, needed to adapt to run slower, but for longer,&rsquo; says Lieberman.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He argues that long ago on the African savannah, natural selection made us into &lsquo;supremely adapted&rsquo; endurance athletes, capable of running prey into the ground and ranging over long distances with unusual efficiency. But only, it appears, if we train. Otherwise we quickly degenerate into couch potatoes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As for speed, even those animals that do cover impressive distances don&rsquo;t have to be the fastest they can possibly be. Barnacle geese needn&rsquo;t set world records when crossing the North Atlantic; they just need to be able to get to their destination. &lsquo;And,&rsquo; says exercise physiologist Ross Tucker, &lsquo;humans may be the only animal that actually cares about reaching peak performance.&rsquo; Other than racehorses and greyhounds, both of which we have bred to race, animals aren&rsquo;t directly competing against one another. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that all animals are the same, performance-wise &hellip; and we don&rsquo;t know whether training would enhance their ability,&rsquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Questions 28-30<br></span><span class="c0">Choose the correct letter A, B, C or D.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">28.

For fifty years we have been providing top-quality courses for actors, directors, producers, musicians and everyone else who wishes to work professionally in the theatre or related industries. We also have expertise in preparing students for the specialised requirements of TV, film and radio. We&rsquo;ll make sure you&rsquo;re thoroughly prepared for the reality of work in your chosen field.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Our college-based tutors all have extensive practical experience in the entertainment industry as well as academic qualifications, and we also collaborate with some of the country&rsquo;s best directors, writers and actors to create challenging, inspiring and exciting projects with our students.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We are well-known around the world, with our students coming from every continent. Every year, we receive two thousand applications for the one hundred places on our degree courses. Only the most talented get places, and we are proud that over ninety percent of our students gain professional work within a year of graduating &ndash; a figure few other drama colleges in the UK can match.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To mark our fiftieth anniversary this year, we are putting on a production of Theatre 500. Written by two staff members especially for this occasion, this multimedia show celebrates five hundred years of drama, and involves all our students in one way or another.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Another major development is that the college is about to move. Our new premises are now under construction in the heart of Thornley, next to the council building, which has won a prize for its architecture. For the last two years, we have been developing designs with Miller Furbank Architects for our new home, and one aim has been to ensure the buildings complement the council offices. Work started on the foundations of the buildings in March last year, and we plan to move to the new site this coming September.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We have also been talking to cultural organisations in the district, and considering how we can bring cost-free benefits to the local community, as well as to our students. As a result, part of the space in the new buildings has been designed to be adaptable, in order to accommodate classes, performances and workshops for different-sized groups of local people.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Questions 8-14<br></span><span class="c0">Do the following statements agree with the information given in the text?

Most of us get so bogged down with day-to-day tasks though, that we easily forget why we originally applied for the job and what we can get out of it. Here are a few ideas for how to make your working day better.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Physical changes to your work environment can make a massive difference to how you feel. Get some green plants or a family photo for your desk. File all those odd bits of paper or throw them away. All of these little touches can make your work environment feel like it&rsquo;s yours. Make sure any screens you have are at a suitable height so you&rsquo;re not straining your neck and shoulders.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Humans need a change of environment every now and then to improve productivity. Go out at lunchtime for a quick walk. If you have the option, it&rsquo;s a good idea to work from home occasionally. And if there&rsquo;s a conference coming up, ask if you can go along to it. Not only will you practise your networking skills, but you&rsquo;ll also have a day away from the office.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Use coffee time to get to know a colleague you don&rsquo;t usually speak to. There&rsquo;s no point in getting away from staring at one thing though, only to replace it with another; so leave your mobile alone! Another tip is to try and stay out of office gossip. In the long run it could get you in more trouble than you realise.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When you&rsquo;re trying to focus on something, hunger is the worst thing, if you can, keep some healthy snacks in your desk because if you have something you can nibble on, it will make you work more effectively and you&rsquo;ll enjoy it more. Also, if you&rsquo;re dehydrated, you won&rsquo;t be able to focus properly. So keep drinking water.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Finally, if you&rsquo;ve been dreaming about starting up a big project for some time, do it! There are so many different things you can do to get you enjoying work more each day.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Questions 15-20<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the sentences below.

You are perhaps the most important part in the &lsquo;promotion process&rsquo;, so you need to know what you want &ndash; and why you want it. Take an honest look at yourself &ndash; your achievements and also your skills, particularly those you could exploit to take on a different role.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Your boss is the gatekeeper. If you think your boss is likely to be on your side, ask for a meeting to discuss your serious commitment to the organisation and how this could translate into a more defined career plan. If you are less sure about your boss&rsquo;s view of your prospects and how they may react, start softly with a more deliberate focus on increasing your boss&rsquo;s understanding of the work you do and the added value you deliver.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Think about how you are perceived at work. In order for you to get your promotion, who needs to know about you? Who would be on the interview panel and whose opinion and input would they seek? And once you&rsquo;ve got a list of people to impress, ask yourself &ndash; do they know enough about you? And I mean really know &ndash; what you do day to day at your desk, your contribution to the team, and perhaps most importantly, your potential.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The chances are that those decision-makers won&rsquo;t know ail they should about you. Raising your profile in your organisation is critical so that when those in charge start looking at that empty office and considering how best to fill it, the first name that pops into their heads is yours. If your firm has a newsletter, volunteer to write a feature to include in it. If they arrange regular client events, get involved in the organisation of them. And so on.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you think your experience needs enhancing, then look at ways you can continue to improve it. If you are confident in your professional expertise but lack the latest management theory, enrol on some relevant courses that fit around your day job.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So what are you waiting for?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Questions 21-27<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the notes below.

But Professor Marc Bekoff, an ecologist at University of Colorado, Boulder, US, believes that morals are &lsquo;hard-wired&rsquo; into the brains of all mammals and provide the social glue&rsquo; that allows animals to live together in groups.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His conclusions will assist animal welfare groups pushing to have animals treated more humanely. Professor Bekoff, who presents his case in his book Wild Justice, said: &lsquo;Just as in humans, the moral nuances of a particular culture or group will be different from another, but they are certainly there. Moral codes are species specific, so they can be difficult to compare with each other or with humans.&rsquo; Professor Bekoff believes morals developed in animals to help regulate behaviour in social groups. He claims that these help to limit fighting within the group and encourage co-operative behaviour.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His ideas have met with some controversy in the scientific community. Professor Frans de Waal, who examines the behaviour of primates, including chimpanzees, at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, US, said: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe animals are moral in the sense we humans are &ndash; with a well-developed and reasoned sense of right and wrong &ndash; rather that human morality incorporates a set of psychological tendencies and capacities such as empathy, reciprocity, a desire for co-operation and harmony that are older than our species. Human morality was not formed from scratch, but grew out of our primate psychology. Primate psychology has ancient roots and I agree that other animals show many of the same tendencies and have an intense sociality.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wolves live in tight-knit social groups that are regulated by strict rules. Wolves also demonstrate fairness. During play, dominant wolves will appear to exchange roles with lower-ranking wolves. They pretend to be submissive and go so far as to allow biting by the lower-ranking wolves, provided it is not too hard. Prof Bekoff argues that without a moral code governing their actions, this kind of behaviour would not be possible. Astonishingly, if an animal becomes aggressive, it will perform a play bow&rsquo; to ask forgiveness before play resumes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In other members of the dog family, play is controlled in a similar way. Among coyotes, cubs which are too aggressive are ignored by the rest of the group and often end up having to leave entirely. Experiments with domestic dogs, where one animal was given some sweets&rsquo; and another wasn&rsquo;t, have shown that they possess a sense of fairness as they allowed their companion to eat some.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elephants are intensely sociable and emotional animals. Research by Iain Douglas-Hamilton, from the department of zoology at Oxford University, suggests elephants experience compassion and has found evidence of elephants helping injured members of their herd. In 2003, a herd of 11 elephants rescued antelopes which were being held inside an enclosure in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The top female elephant unfastened all of the metal latches holding the gates closed and swung them open, allowing the antelopes to escape. This is thought to be a rare example of animals showing empathy for members of another species &ndash; a trait previously thought to be the exclusive preserve of humankind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A laboratory experiment involved training Diana monkeys to insert a token into a slot to obtain food. A male who had become skilled at the task was found to be helping the oldest female, who had not learned how to do it. On three occasions the male monkey picked up tokens she dropped and inserted them into the slot and allowed her to have the food. As there was no benefit for the male monkey, Professor Bekoff argues that this is a clear example of an animal&rsquo;s actions being driven by some internal moral compass.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since chimpanzees are known to be among the most cognitively advanced of the great apes and our closest cousins, it is perhaps not remarkable that scientists should suggest they live by moral codes. A chimpanzee known as Knuckles is the only known captive chimpanzee to suffer from cerebral palsy, which leaves him physically and mentally impaired. What is extraordinary is that scientists have observed other chimpanzees interacting with him differently and he is rarely subjected to intimidating displays of aggression from older males. Chimpanzees also demonstrate a sense of justice and those who deviate from the code of conduct of a group are set upon by other members as punishment.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Experiments with rats have shown that they will not take food if they know their actions will cause pain to another rat. In lab tests, rats were given food which then caused a second group of rats to receive an electric shock. The rats with the food stopped eating rather than see this happen.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Whales have been found to have spindle cells in their brains. These specialised cells were thought to be restricted to humans and great apes, and appear to play a role in empathy and understanding the emotions of others. Humpback whales, fin whales, killer whales and sperm whales have all been found to have spindle cells. They also have three times as many spindle cells as humans and are thought to be older in evolutionary terms. This finding suggests that emotional judgements such as empathy may have evolved considerably earlier in history than formerly thought and could be widespread in the animal kingdom.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Questions 28-32<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the summary below.
