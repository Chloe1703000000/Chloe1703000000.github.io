We use trained and experienced instructors to give you the opportunity to learn and develop climbing skills, keep fit and have fun. Master our 11 m-high climbing walls using a rope harness, for an unbeatable sense of achievement. Or experience the thrills of climbing without any harness in our special low-level arena, which has foam mats on the floor is cushion any fall safety.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Who is Big Rock for?<br></span><span class="c1">Almost anyone can enjoy Big Rock. Previous climbing experience and specialist equipment are not required. You can come on your own or with friends and family comes as a fun alternative to the gym or for a special day out with the kids. If you are visiting the friends or family but not climbing, or just fancy coming to look, please feel free to relax in our excellent cafe overlooking the climbing areas.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Mobile Climbing Wall<br></span><span class="c1">Available on a day hire basis at any location, the big Rock mobile Climbing Wall is the perfect way to enhance any show festival or event. The mobile wall can be used indoors or outdoors and features four unique 7.3 m-high climbing faces designed to allow four people to climb simultaneously. Quick to set up and pack up, the mobile climbing wall is staffed by qualified and experienced climbing instructors, providing the opportunity to climb the wall in a controlled and safe environment. when considering what to wear, we have found that trousers and t-shirts are ideal. We will however, ask people to remove scarves. Most flat shoes are suitable as long as they are enclosed and support the foot. The mobile wall is very adaptable and can be operated in light rain and winds up to 50 kph. There are however, particular measures that we take in such conditions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">What about hiring the mobile climbing wall for my school or college?<br></span><span class="c1">As climbing is different from the usual team games practiced at schools, we have found that some students who don&rsquo;t usually like participating in sports are willing to have a go on the mobile climbing wall. If you are connected that some children may not want to take part because they feel nervous if they climb, then please be assured that our instructors will support then up to a level which they are comfortable with. They will still benefit greatly from the experience.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Questions 9-14<br></span><span class="c1">Do the following statement agree with the information given in the text<br>In boxes 9-14 on your answer sheet write</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">TRUE</span><span class="c8">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if the statement agrees with the information<br></span><span class="c5">FALSE</span><span class="c8">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if the statement contradicts the information<br></span><span class="c5">NOT GIVEN</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if there is no information on this</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">9.

So if you&lsquo;re advertising where they&rsquo;re just not looking, it&rsquo;s wasted money. That&rsquo;s why it pays to do a bit of research. Every time someone contacts your company, ask them where they found out about you. And act on this information so you&rsquo;re advertising in the right places.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Always think like a customer<br></span><span class="c1">What makes your customers tick? Find out, and you&rsquo;re halfway to saying the right things in your advertising. So take the time to ask them. A simple phone or email survey of your own customers, politely asking why they use you, what they really like and what they don&rsquo;t, is invaluable.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Make sure customers know you&rsquo;re there</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If a customer can&lsquo;t see you, they can&lsquo;t buy from you. There are loads of opportunities to promote your business &mdash; print, press, direct mail, telemarketing, email and the internet &mdash; and using a mix of these increases your chances of being seen (and remembered).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ignore your customers and they&rsquo;ll go away</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It sounds obvious, but companies who talk to their customers have much better retention rates than those that don&rsquo;t, so it&rsquo;s worth staying in touch. Capture your customers&rsquo; email addresses upfront. Follow up a transaction to check they&rsquo;re happy with the service and, if possible, send them updates that are helpful, informative and relevant.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Know what works (and what doesn&rsquo;t)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Do what the professionals do, and measure all your advertising. That&rsquo;ll tell you what you&rsquo;re doing right &mdash; and where there&rsquo;s room for improvement. You never know, it might just throw up some information that could change your business for the better.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Remember word-of-mouth: the best advertising there is</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A recent survey found that consumers are 50% more likely to be in&#64258;uenced by word-of-mouth recommendations than by TV or radio ads. So your reputation is your greatest asset If your current customers are impressed with your company, they&rsquo;ll be more inclined to recommend you to others. On the &#64258;ip side, if they experience bad service they probably won&rsquo;t complain to you &mdash; but you can be sure they will to their friends.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Questions 15-20<br></span><span class="c8">Complete the sentences below.

Although few are constructed nowadays, they have a history stretching back well over two thousand years. Several myths show that the ancient Greeks were interested in the creation of automata. In one, Hephaestus, the god of all mechanical arts, was reputed to have made two female statues of pure gold which assisted him and accompanied him wherever he went. As well as giving automata a place in mythology, the Greeks almost certainly created some. These were probably activated by levers and powered by human action, although there are descriptions of steam and water being used as sources of power. Automata were sometimes intended as toys, or as tools for demonstrating basic scienti&#64257;c principles.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Other ancient cultures, too, seem to have developed automata. In Egypt, Ctesibius experimented with air pressure and pneumatic principles. One of his creations was a singing blackbird powered by water. A Chinese text of the third century BC describes a life-size, human-shaped &#64257;gure that could walk rapidly, move its head up and down, sing and wink its eye.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Much later, Arab engineers of the ninth and thirteenth centuries wrote detailed treatises on how to build programmable musical fountains, mechanical servants, and elaborate clocks. A ninth-century ruler in Baghdad had a silver and gold tree with metal birds that sang. The art of creating automata developed considerably during the &#64257;fteenth century, linked with improvements in clock making: the mechanisms of automata and clocks had a great deal in common. Some truly remarkable automata were produced at this time. Muller was reputed to have made an arti&#64257;cial eagle which &#64258;ew to greet the Emperor on his entry into Nuremberg, Germany, in 1470, then returned to perch on top of a city gate and, by stretching its wings and bowing, saluted the emperor on his arrival. Leonardo da Vinci made a lion in honour of the king of France, which advanced towards him, stopped, opened its chest with a claw and pointed to the French coat of arms.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Automata were normally very expensive toys for the very rich. They were made for royal or aristocratic patrons, to be viewed only by themselves and selected guests &ndash; who were expected to be impressed by their wealth. Automata were also created for public show, however, and many appeared on clock towers, such as me one in Bern, Switzerland, built in 1530.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">During the eighteenth century, some watchmakers made automata to contribute to the progress of medicine and the natural sciences, particularly to investigate the mechanical laws governing the structure and movement of living things. Many of their creations simulated almost perfectly the complex structure of human beings and animals. Maillardet made extensive use of gearing and cogs to produce automata of horses, worked by turning a handle. Vaucanson produced a duck made of gilded copper which ate, drank and quacked like a real duck. He also made a life-size Female flute player. Air passes through the complex mechanism, causing the lips and &#64257;ngers of the player to move naturally on the flute, opening and closing holes on it. This automaton had a repertoire of twelve tunes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In another well&mdash;known piece, Merlin&rsquo;s silver swan made in 1773, the swan sits in a stream consisting of glass rods where small silver &#64257;sh are swimming. When the clockwork is wound, a music box plays and the glass rods rotate, giving the impression of a &#64258;owing stream. The swan turns its head from side to side. lt soon notices the &#64257;sh and bends down to catch and. eat one, then raises its head to the upright position. The mechanism still works.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One of the most skilled makers of automata was the Swiss watchmaker jaquet-Droz. He produced three automata which, even today, are considered wonders of science and mechanical engineering. One of these, The Writer, simulates a boy sitting at a desk, dipping his pen into the ink and writing perfectly legibly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Another Stunning creation of the eighteenth century was the Mechanical Theatre in the grounds of Austria&rsquo;s Hellbrunn Palace, home of the Archbishop of Salzburg. Designed by the miner Rosenegger, and completed in 1752, this depicts the nobility&rsquo;s idea of a perfect society, with every class in its proper place. The &#64257;gures inside a palace depict eighteenth- century court life, while industrious activity is carried on in and around this building. A total of 141 mobile and 52 immobile little &#64257;gures demonstrate all manner of trades of the period: building workers bring materials to the foreman, who drinks; butchers slaughter an ox; a barber shaves a man. A dancing bear performs, guards march past the palace, a farmer pushes an old woman in a wheelbarrow over the road. The theatre shows great skill in clock making and water technology, consisting of hidden waterwheels, copper wiring and cogwheels.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">During the nineteenth century, mass production techniques meant that automata could be made cheaply and easily, and they became toys for children rather than an expensive adult amusement. Between 1860 and 1910, small family businesses in Paris made thousands of clockwork automata and mechanical singing birds and exported them around the world. However, the twentieth century saw traditional forms of automata fall out of favour.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Questions 28-30<br></span><span class="c8">Complete the summary below.<br>Choose </span><span class="c5">ONE WORD ONLY</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;from the text for each answer.<br>Write your answers in boxes 28-30 on your answer sheet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Automata and the ancient Greeks</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The ancient Greeks had a number of 28 &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;concerning automate.

These programmes always involve work experience as well as classroom instruction and produce Workers skilled in the occupation. There is a written contract to be signed by the apprentice and the employer, which acknowledges their joint commitment to the training process. This contract is approved and registered by the New York State Department of Labor.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">How Do I Qualify?<br></span><span class="c1">First of all you must meet the employer&rsquo;s minimum quali&#64257;cations. This could be a high school diploma or the equivalent. However, some employers will ask for speci&#64257;c high school courses, prior experience, or occupationally related courses.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">What Is My Training Like?<br></span><span class="c1">Training for each apprenticeable occupation is conducted according to a training outline that has been standardized for the occupation. This assures that apprentices across the state have the same sets of basic competencies and skills.

Each trade has a de&#64257;nite term of training, listed in years As a registered apprentice, you may progress according to that established training term, or you may become skilled more quickly or more slowly. It may even be that you start your apprenticeship with credit toward the goal. Your employer may choose to award you this for previous working experience in the occupation, or for prior coursework related to the occupation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As an apprentice, you are part of the employer&rsquo;s workforce. You work full-time for the employer. A registered apprentice works under the guidance of more experienced craft workers called journey workers. From them, you learn the skills of die trade. As you master each skill, you become a more productive employee.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the same time as you are working, you are also required to attend classes (usually in the evenings).

Before the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, water transportation was the most ef&#64257;cient means of moving heavy or bulk freight, and the Humber, situated at the heart of the waterway system associated with the two major rivers, was one of the chief highways of England. its traf&#64257;c brought prosperity to the settlements on its banks, particularly the city of Hull on its north bank, but the river itself tended to cut them off from some of their closest neighbours, as well as obstructing the progress of travellers moving north or south.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">B</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;To cater for these local and, as time progressed, wider needs, ferries were provided across many of the streams &#64258;owing into the Humber, and in 1315, a ferry was established across the Humber itself between Hull and Lincolnshire. By 1800, this ferry had become fully integrated into the overland transport system, but the changes associated with the industrial revolution were soon to threaten its position. Increased traf&#64257;c encouraged speculators to establish rival ferries between Hull and Lincolnshire, notably a service between Hull and New Holland which opened in 1826. This crossing was considerably shorter than on the existing Hull to Barton service, which closed in 1851, unable to cope with the increased competition from the rival service.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The New Holland ferry service then grew into a major link between the north and south banks of the Humber, carrying passengers, and cattle and goods bound for Hull Market. In 1968, there was brie&#64258;y a ferry service from Grimsby to Hull involving hovercrafts. This did not last long as the hovercrafts could not cope with the demands of the River Humber. The ferry service between Hull and New Holland ended with the opening of the Humber Bridge in 1981.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">C</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The bridge was the outcome of over 100 years of campaigning by local interests for the construction of a bridge or tunnel across the estuary. The first major crossing proposal was a tunnel scheme in 1872. This scheme was promoted by Hull merchants and businesses dissatis&#64257;ed with the serviice provided by the New Holland ferry crossing. Over the next 100 years, a variety of proposals were put forward in an effort to bridge the Humber. In 1928, a plan was drawn up by Hull City Council to build a multi-span bridge four miles west of Hull. However, the scheme was dropped after being hit by the &#64257;nancial woes of the Great Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">D</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Government approval for the construction of a suspension bridge was &#64257;nally granted in 1959, although it was not until 1973 that work &#64257;nally began. The reasons why a suspension bridge was chosen were twofold. Firstly, the Humber has a shitting bed, and the navigable channel along which a craft can travel is always changing; a suspension bridge with no support piers in mid-stream would not obstruct the estuary. Secondly, because of the geology and topography of the area, the cost of constructing a tunnel would have been excessive.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">E</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Work on the construction proceeded for eight years, during which time many thousands of tonnes of steel and concrete were used and upwards of one thousand workers and staff were employed at times of peak activity. The designers had been responsible for two other major suspension bridges in Britain but, with a total span of 2,220 m, or almost a mile and a half, the Humber was going to be the longest suspension bridge in the world. Nowadays designers have computers, but back then everything was done with slide rules and calculators. The towers were concrete rather than the usual steel, since concrete was cheaper and would blend in better with the setting. The bridge was designed to stand for 120 years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">F</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Malcolm Stockwell, the bridgemaster, recalls that when the bridge &#64257;rst opened, there wasn&rsquo;t a great deal of interest in it. Then children started visiting, and he remembers their astonishment at seeing the control room and all the lights. People who lived in towns on opposite banks a mile apart started crossing the river &mdash; a journey that previously might as well have been to the moon. The bridge brought them together. .</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">G</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The bridge opened up, both socially and economically, two previously remote and insular areas of England, and the improvement in communication enabled the area to realise its potential in commercial, industrial and tourist development. The bridge has saved many millions of vehicle miles and many valuable hours of drivers&rsquo; and passengers&rsquo; time &ndash; an important factor not only for the drivers and operators of commercial vehicles, but also for tourists and holidaymakers who would have had to travel around the estuary to reach destinations in the region. ln the words of Malcolm Stockwell, &lsquo;Although it can&rsquo;t beat the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco for setting, it far outstrips it for sheer elegance and as a piece of engineering.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Questions 28-34<br></span><span class="c1">The text on pages 46-47 has seven sections, A-G.<br>Choose the correct heading for each section from the list of headings below.<br>Write the correct number i-x, in boxes 28-34 on your answer sheet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">List of Headings<br></span><span class="c1">i Why the ferry crossing has always been difficult<br>ii Building the bridge<br>iii An advantage of the design for the bridge<br>iv The growing popularity of the bridge<br>v Opposition to building a bridge<br>vi Bene&#64257;ts and disadvantages the Humber has brought<br>vii Proposed alternatives to ferry services<br>viii How the bridge has contributed to the region&rsquo;s growth<br>ix Rising demand for river transport</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">28 Section A<br>29 Section B<br>30 Section C<br>31 Section D<br>32 Section E<br>33 Section F<br>34 Section G</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Questions 35-40<br></span><span class="c8">Complete the summary below<br>Choose </span><span class="c5">ONE WORD ONLY</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;from the text for each answer.<br>Write your answers in boxes 35-40 on your answer sheet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Crossing the Humber</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The &#64257;rst ferry across the Humber started operating in 1315, and by 1800, this service had been 35&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;with other forms of transport.

They may:<br>&bull; be keen to retain current staff<br>&bull; want to compete for new talent<br>&bull; be seeking a fairer way of distributing wages.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In order for performance-related schemes to work they should be based on clear, measurable targets agreed by both employer and employee. You will normally find out about these targets from your contract of employment and the performance appraisal meetings you have with your manager.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Short-term schemes<br></span><span class="c1">Short-term schemes usually offer bonus payments, or, depending on the type of work, commission on sales achieved.

According to research published in Science last November, stocks of all the fish and shellfish that we currently eat will collapse before 2050. Or at least that&rsquo;s how the media reported it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">B<br></span><span class="c1">However the scientist who led the study has said that the main conclusion of his research has been buried beneath the headlines. While the danger to our seafood supply is real enough, says Boris Worm, assistant professor of marine conservation biology at Dalhousie University, Canada, there is a more serious point: that the way in which we manage the oceans is not only threatening the survival of individual species, it&rsquo;s upsetting the delicate balance of marine communities and thus causing the collapse of entire ecosystems. Research has shown that the number of ecosystems where all higher forms of life are extinct, so-called dead zones is increasing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The point that many reports failed to highlight, says Worm, is that we have to revolutionise the way our marine resources are run, changing the focus from stocks and quotas to biodiversity and ecosystem protection. And to do that, we must change the way the debate about our marine resources is conducted in the public domain.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">C<br></span><span class="c1">Around 7,500 years ago, shrinking glaciers and the resulting higher water levels led to the development of what&rsquo;s called the Wadden Sea, a 13,500-square-kilometre area of the North Sea. During the first 5,000 years or so, the sea pulsated with life. There was a high level of biodiversity on the seabed too, and the salt marshes and mud flats on the coast supported millions of birds. This continued until around 2,000 years ago, when human pressure began to affect it. Research has shown that some of the larger creatures disappeared more than 500 years ago. And by the late<br>19th century, populations of most of the other mammals and fish were severely reduced, leading to the collapse of several traditional fisheries.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">D<br></span><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s interesting is that overfishing isn&rsquo;t the main agent of the decline, as we might assume. It&rsquo;s due to an ongoing combination of exploitation, habitat destruction and pollution. Coastal development, for example, destroys large areas of wetlands that support a range of species. Pollution fuels a process known as eutrophication, which kills certain seagrasses. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus contained in human and industrial waste promote the growth of tiny phytoplankton. This over-enrichment of the sea can ultimately lead to the collapse of the entire system through oxygen starvation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Most marine ecosystems have an in-built capacity to deal with a certain amount of pollution because shellfish can absorb phytoplankton. But in many cases, these have been largely removed by fishing, so the effect of any nutrient-rich pollutants entering the system is increased. In a healthy system, coastal wetlands also act as filters, so their destruction causes even more pollution. These processes have been fairly well understood for a number of years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">E<br></span><span class="c1">What the Science paper has demonstrated, however, is that the decline in the health of ecosystems is greater where the number of different species is low. The population of marbled rock cod around the South Atlantic island of South Georgia, for example, still hasn&rsquo;t recovered after the fishing industry caused its collapse during the 1970s. By contrast, North Sea cod has withstood very heavy fishing for hundreds of years, says Worm, and although it has declined substantially, it hasn&rsquo;t yet collapsed completely. Worm believes that, &lsquo;to have a greater number of species makes an ecosystem more robust&rsquo;. His theory is backed up by evidence from experiments into how ecosystems react to change.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">F<br></span><span class="c1">And some positive news came from the study. Worm and his colleagues were able to show that it&rsquo;s possible to reverse such damage as long as there are enough species. A survey of 44 protected areas revealed increases in biodiversity and fish catches close to the reserves. Worm says, &lsquo;We should be focusing our attention on protecting all of our marine resources at the ecosystem level, and managing levels of fishing, pollution and habitat disturbance to ensure that crucial services that maintain the health of the ecosystem continue to function.&rsquo; To anyone who knows anything about ecology, it would appear that Worm is just stating the obvious. And many protected areas on land are now managed in this way.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">G<br></span><span class="c1">However, there has long been a tendency to view our oceans as a limitless resource, combined with a widespread failure to make an emotional connection with most marine wildlife. True, we have created a small number of marine protected areas. &lsquo;We seem to have understood the value of protecting ecosystems in areas such as the Australian Great Barrier Reef that we consider to be particularly beautiful/ says John Shepherd, Professor of Marine Sciences at Southampton University in the UK. &lsquo;Human nature will always draw us towards those species or habitats that are more aesthetically pleasing. That&rsquo;s why there will always be support for protecting pandas and very little for worms, even though nematodes play a vital role in maintaining the health of an ecosystem.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Questions 35-37</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Choose the correct letter, A, B, C or D.<br>Write the correct letter in boxes 35-37 on your answer sheet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">35 Boris Worm&rsquo;s main concern is that</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">A</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;marine ecosystems will completely break down.<br></span><span class="c5">B</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;insufficient attention is being paid to fish numbers.<br></span><span class="c5">C</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;there will no longer be enough seafood for people to eat.<br></span><span class="c5">D</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;politicians will be unwilling to discuss marine resources.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">36 What point does John Shepherd make?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">A</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Marine conservation areas are not high on the list of visitor attractions.<br></span><span class="c5">B</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;People know very little about how different species actually live.<br></span><span class="c5">C</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;The public are much less likely to help unattractive creatures.<br></span><span class="c5">D</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The marine environment was better understood in the past.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">37 Which of the following best summarises the text as a whole?<br></span><span class="c5">A</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Scientists disagree about the state of the world&rsquo;s oceans.<br></span><span class="c5">B</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;A radical review of marine resource management is needed.<br></span><span class="c5">C</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;The fishing industry is mainly responsible for today&rsquo;s problems.<br></span><span class="c5">D</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The natural systems of our seas will not be able to repair themselves.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Questions 38-40<br></span><span class="c8">Complete the summary below.<br>Choose </span><span class="c5">ONE WORD ONLY</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;from the text for each answer.<br>Write your answers in boxes 38-40 on your answer sheet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Wadden Sea</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Wadden Sea was created when the sea rose as a consequence of 38&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;slowly contracting.

This continued until species began to decline 2,000 years ago. Overfishing was partly responsible for the changing circumstances, and so was pollution. At the same time there has been an increase in some nutrients in the Wadden Sea which can also destroy marine creatures and vegetation by depriving them of 40&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;which is essential for their survival.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c7">TEST 4</span></p><p class="c10 c4"><span class="c0">music clubs</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">A</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Whitehay Youth Music is intended for anyone aged between 6 and 14 who is keen to perform in public.

If you&rsquo;re offered a job, it&rsquo;s because the organisation sees you as a valuable asset and you should try to set your level of remuneration accordingly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There are no general rules about how and when to conduct your negotiation but being sensitive to the culture of the organisation is essential. There are also some practical steps you can take to position yourself sensibly. Familiarise yourself with the company itself, as well as the range of salaries on offer. Doing careful research in this way prior to starting negotiations is very valuable. You can look at the range of packages offered for comparable jobs in adverts on the internet, or ask for advice from people you know professionally or personally. You could also approach a local Training and Enterprise Council. Finally, if you&rsquo;re a member of a union, they will have information on acceptable salary ranges for your profession.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If the salary offered is less than you&rsquo;d hoped for, you could negotiate an early pay review instead, say after the first six months. Ensure that the criteria are clearly set out though, and that they&rsquo;re included in your contract.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Make sure you check out the salary package, not just the number of zeroes on your payslip. You may find that the total package of pay and benefits raises the worth of the salary to an acceptable level. For instance, you may be offered private health cover, a non-contributory pension, a car to use for work purposes and/or significant bonuses. When bonuses are mentioned, you may want to discuss the basis on which they&rsquo;re paid, so that you&rsquo;re absolutely clear about the terms and conditions attached.

There are many factors that can cause a project to veer off its tracks, but steps can be taken to ensure that your project experiences as little disruption as possible.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">1. Prepare the framework</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you get everything down in writing at the beginning of the project, you have an excellent foundation to build upon. Change is inevitable, but you have to maintain control. This is critical to avoid problems of &lsquo;scope creep&rsquo;, which is when the company paying for the project asks for &lsquo;just one more little thing&rsquo; repeatedly, until the project becomes unmanageable.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">2. Select the team</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gather your human resources, and make sure that their skills align with their roles. This is an important first step: if you assign the wrong person to a task, you are reducing your chances of success.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Make sure each team member is clear on what is expected from them and when. Encourage them to ask questions to clarify anything that may be uncertain, and to always come to you whenever something seems to be out of place or going wrong. Clear communication is critical.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Make sure the whole team and the client company grasp the project&rsquo;s limitations in terms of its achievable outcomes. You can finish a task successfully and on time as long as expectations are reasonable.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">3. Staying on track</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How can you know if your project is going to be successful if you don&rsquo;t have any way of measuring success? You will need interim milestones, especially for a long-term project, so that you can determine if you are staying on track or straying from the project&rsquo;s goals.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">4. Manage project risks</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hopefully you have defined the more likely risks up front during the project preparation, so you should now put contingency plans in place for certain occurrences. If you can see when a risk is imminent, you can take preventive action to avoid it, but be ready to halt a project if the risk becomes unacceptable.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">5. Evaluate the project<br></span><span class="c1">Once a project has been completed, it&rsquo;s important to write a report, even if it is only for internal purposes. You can pinpoint what went right or wrong, determine what could have been done differently, and establish the best practices for use in future undertakings.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Questions 21-27<br></span><span class="c8">Complete the flow-chart below.

For an instant I look straight into its gaping mouth and see the row of small, flattened teeth in its lower jaw. Close on its tail comes another manta ray, and another and another. The manta rays are unaffected by my being there, cruising past in a leisurely fashion without seeming to expend any great effort.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">B</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;From above, the manta rays are great black silhouettes that fishermen called &lsquo;devil fish&rsquo;, because of the curious horn-like fins hanging down near their mouths. But looking into their eyes you get a sense of their peaceful nature. Unlike stingrays, mantas don&rsquo;t have venomous spines in their tails, and unlike many fish species they seem to enjoy human company. Once, over-enthusiastically, I swim towards a manta. I am just a few inches away when it senses me. To my surprise, the whole fish twitches in alarm and shoots off, perhaps fearing that I will touch it. I feel ashamed to have given it a fright.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">C</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I have come to Hanifaru, a small lagoon next to an uninhabited island in the Maldives, especially to see manta rays. These great harmless creatures congregate here during the south-west monsoons between May and November and, if the tides and winds are right, enter a shallow cul-de-sac in the reef to hunt for plankton, their main source of nutrition. On certain days the bay can attract more than 100 mantas. I have seen many manta rays on dives around the world, though not in these numbers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">D</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Guy Stevens is my guide, a British marine biologist who has been studying the mantas for the past five years. Based at the nearby Four Seasons resort, he has identified more than 2,000 individual manta rays, photographing and cataloguing them according to their distinctive skin patterns. Each day we make the 40-minute boat journey from the resort to Hanifaru. Feeding events, as Guy calls them, are never guaranteed, but, during the season, hotel guests can sign up for &lsquo;manta alerts&rsquo;. If Guy and his research assistants spot significant manta activity, the guests will be brought by fast speedboat to the lagoon to snorkel. When feeding, the mantas of Hanifaru tend to stay near the surface, making them accessible to snorkellers just as much as divers. They seem not to mind the human competition in this quite small space, and indeed they are often joined by other rays and even giant whale sharks, which feed on the same plankton.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">E</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Word among the diving community about the possibility of finding a mass of manta rays at Hanifaru has slowly been spreading over the past year. Outside the shallow lagoon I can see five large safari boats &ndash; live-aboard cruisers that take divers around the best underwater sites in the Maldives. It is something that Guy has been monitoring closely. &lsquo;Word is out that Hanifaru is a top manta spot,&rsquo; he explains, &lsquo;and although the government has declared the bay a &ldquo;protected area&rdquo;, we still don&rsquo;t have any regulations in force to limit the number of people in the water at any one time.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">F</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;During my stay, the resort received a visit from the then-president of the Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed. Since coming to power in 2008, he had made his interest in the marine environment and concerns about climate change well known. In 2009 he held an underwater cabinet meeting, urging other world leaders to act decisively to combat climate change. The protection of wildlife areas such as Hanifaru was clearly one of his objectives, and I asked him why he took such an interest. &lsquo;Maldivians have lived with the reefs and their fish life since long before there were tourists,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;And while tourist dollars are good for our country, the sea and its produce are even more vital to my people. I have to balance what tourists want to see with preserving the marine environment &ndash; and in some cases, like Hanifaru, those objectives coincide.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">G</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;On several dives I am lucky enough to get close to the mantas, sometimes at underwater &lsquo;cleaning stations&rsquo;. Here, the mantas come in small numbers, or individually, to pause above a coral outcrop and wait while small fish pick at their skin, removing parasites. Adapted for fast swimming with their flattened bodies, they can accelerate rapidly with a twitch of their wings. They gaze at human swimmers with a kind of knowing calm, something people often remark on when they try to capture the emotion they experience after seeing them. The manta rays have the biggest brain of any fish,&rsquo; Guy explains, &lsquo;and some manta researchers are convinced that mantas can recognise individual people underwater.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">H</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I return to the lagoon over the course of several days and learn more from Guy about his hopes for the future. &lsquo;People can visit this place, but I want to be sure that they don&rsquo;t harass the mantas by touching them or crowding them out while they&rsquo;re feeding. We&rsquo;re working to get a full-time ranger station and some kind of permit system to limit the number of boats that can enter the lagoon each day.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Questions 28-30<br></span><span class="c1">The text on below page has 8 paragraphs, A-H.
