class="c24 doc-content"><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Section 1<br></span><span class="c0">Read the text below and answer questions 1-7.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c1">What to do if your clothes have been lost or damaged by a dry cleaner</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dry cleaners are legally required to take reasonable care of anything left with them. You can claim compensation if your belongings are damaged or lost while in their care.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if the dry cleaning company has a sign saying they aren&rsquo;t responsible for items left with them, this isn&rsquo;t necessarily true. They can&rsquo;t opt out of this responsibility just by putting up a sign.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as you realise there&rsquo;s a problem, contact them and explain the situation. They might offer you compensation straight away. If they don&rsquo;t, you should ask them to either cover the cost of repairing the item or to pay for a replacement (if it can&rsquo;t be repaired).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"><br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If they have to pay the cost of replacing a damaged or lost item, the maximum they&rsquo;re obliged to offer you is the value of the item when it was left with them, not what it would cost to replace as new. You&rsquo;ll probably be asked to provide evidence of how much it originally cost &ndash; for example, a receipt. The dry cleaner can then offer you a reduced amount depending on the condition of the item &ndash; you&rsquo;ll have to negotiate the cost with them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If the dry cleaner is part of a national chain, you could get in touch with the customer services department of their head office and make the complaint to them directly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If the dry cleaner refuses to compensate you or they offer you too little, try the following steps:<br>&bull; If the dry cleaner is a member of a trade association such as the UK Fashion and Textile Association, you can pass your complaint to them and they may be able to help you.<br>&bull; You could get an independent organization to look at your issue and produce a report, but this could be expensive (often around &pound;100).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you&rsquo;ve tried the options above and are still unhappy with the outcome, you could take your case to court. There&rsquo;s a time limit for going to court &ndash; from when you took the item to the dry cleaner, you have up to six years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 1-7<br></span><span class="c0">Do the following statements agree with the information given in the text? In boxes 1-7 on your answer sheet, write</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">TRUE</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if the statement agrees with the information<br></span><span class="c1">FALSE</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if the statement contradicts the information<br></span><span class="c1">NOT GIVEN</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if there is no information on this</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">1. Dry cleaners are generally responsible for items left with them, even if there&rsquo;s a sign saying the opposite.<br>2. If the dry cleaner loses an item belonging to you, they should give you enough money to buy a completely new one.<br>3. If you have the receipt for a damaged item, the company should refund the amount you originally paid for it.<br>4. It may be possible to get support for your complaint from a dry cleaners&rsquo; trade association.<br>5. If you&rsquo;re offered too little compensation, you can request a free report from an independent organisation.<br>6. Most people who take a case about a dry-cleaning company to court are satisfied with the outcome.<br>7. If an item was lost or damaged nine months ago, you can still take the dry cleaner to court.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Read the text below and answer Questions 8-14.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c1">Groups for readers and writers</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A Teenvision<br></span><span class="c0">This is a reading group for teens aged 12-16 which meets on the last Thursday of the month.

Forklift trucks, lifting trolleys, mobile and fixed cranes and all their parts are classed as lifting equipment.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All equipment used for lifting or moving heavy loads should be properly constructed. For example, equipment bearing a CE mark has been constructed to international standards. In addition, equipment that meets these standards will have documented instructions for tests that should be adhered to prior to using the equipment. Certain types of machinery, such as cranes, must be inspected by a qualified engineer on a six-monthly basis.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For operations that use cranes, a formal lift plan must be prepared. Lift plans are a type of risk assessment, whereby the possible dangers of the operation are carefully calculated, and control measures are identified and put in place. Before any lift proceeds, the plan should be talked over with the lifting crew during what is often referred to as a Tool Box Talk&rsquo; (TBT). This is an important opportunity for them to ask questions about their role in the operation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When heavy loads are being moved around, there are some practical things that should be done to prevent accidents. Firstly, if a load needs to be moved where workers or members of the public are present, the area must have barriers or other means to ensure no one is allowed to walk under the load while it is moving. Secondly, someone called a banksman should always be used when moving heavy loads by crane. As a crane driver often cannot see the load, especially during touch-down, this person tells him or her which way to move it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is very unusual for machinery such as cranes to fail. However, it is all too easy to ignore the importance of the secondary equipment. This refers to those items that are attached between the mechanical lifting machine and the load that is being lifted. Chains, slings, shackles and rigging are all examples of secondary lifting equipment, and it is perhaps surprising to note that most injuries occur due to faults or weaknesses in these items. It is essential that a six-monthly visual inspection is carried out to ensure there are no signs of wear or damage to the slings and shackles.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 15-22<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the notes below.

Here are some strategies that will help you handle a customer complaint in a smooth and professional manner.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When a customer presents you with a complaint, keep in mind that the issue is not personal. Aiming to win the confrontation accomplishes nothing. He or she has usually made a purchase that did not meet their expectations &ndash; a product, service, or maybe a combination of the two. A worker who remains in control of their emotions deals from a position of strength.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Let the customer say what they need to. Respond with phrases such as, &lsquo;Hmm&rsquo;, &lsquo;I see&rsquo;, and Tell me more&rsquo;. Then be quiet. As the customer expresses their annoyance yet sees you are not reacting, he or she will begin to relax. The customer needs to do this before being able to hear your solution.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When the customer has calmed down and feels you have heard his or her side, start asking questions. Be careful not to give scripted replies but use this as an opportunity to start a genuine conversation, building a relationship of trust with your customer. To help you understand the situation, get as many details as possible.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Take charge of the situation and let the customer know what you are going to do to solve the problem. One thing to keep in mind is that you should know what you can and cannot do within the policy of the business you work for. The cost could be minimal &ndash; maybe a simple upgrade on the customer&rsquo;s next purchase or a small gift certificate. A simple gesture like this could result in a word-of-mouth recommendation to others, while making a promise you cannot commit to will only set you back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 23-27<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the table below.

No one knows why storks disappeared from our shores. They often featured on the menus of medieval banquets so we might, quite simply, have consumed them all. But there could be a more ominous reason. Storks are migrants arriving after the end of winter, nesting on rooftops and happily associating with humans, and because of this they have long been a symbol of hope and new life. Yet their association with rebirth also meant they became a symbol of rebellion. Shortly after the restoration of King Charles II in 1660, while storks were rare but surviving, parliament debated putting greater effort into destroying them entirely for fear they might inspire republicanism. Today, fortunately, that notion has disappeared and the stork retains its association with new life, appearing on cards given to celebrate the arrival of a new child, as a bird carrying a baby in a sling held in its beak.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">B</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;So, after such a long absence, there was great excitement when in April of this year a pair of white storks built an untidy nest of sticks in the top branches of a huge oak in the middle of our rewilding project at Knepp Estate in West Sussex. Drone footage, taken before the pair started sitting on them, showed three large eggs. The fact that they were infertile and did not hatch was not too disappointing. The pair are only four years old, and storks can live to over thirty, with their first attempts to breed often failing. Prospects for next year are encouraging. These young storks are part of a project to return the species to Britain, inspired by reintroductions in European countries that more than reached their target. Imported from Poland, they have spent the best part of three years in a six-acre pen with a group of other juveniles and several injured, non-flying adults, also from Poland. Other birds have already shown strong loyalty to the site. Two years ago, a young bird from Knepp flew across the Channel to France and, this summer, returned to its companions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">C</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;In the face of reports of unrelenting ecological loss (the UN estimates a million species are on the brink of extinction globally), the white stork&rsquo;s return is refreshing news. As tens of thousands of people demonstrate about the growing climate crisis and eco-anxiety besets us, these glimpses of restoration are important. Featuring the storks in BBC television&rsquo;s Springwatch in June, the ecologist Chris Packham described the project as &lsquo;imaginative, intelligent, progressive and practical&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">D</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;And yet its path to restoration in the UK has not been smooth. Support from conservation bodies has been surprisingly difficult to obtain; some were hard- pressed with their own initiatives, while others were simply reluctant to stick their necks out. In addition, the committee of the Sussex Wildlife Trust raised doubts about the stork ever having been a British bird. They also had concerns that English-bred birds would migrate across the Channel, and feared that their messy nests and closeness to humans would cause a hazard &ndash; rubbish falling down people&rsquo;s chimneys.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So how has the reintroduction project managed to get going? What makes it in some ways special is that it has had to rely on private individuals actually building the introduction pens themselves and feeding the birds at their own expense. The expertise of tiny yet determined conservation charities such as the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation &ndash; responsible for the successful reintroductions of ospreys and white-tailed eagles to Britain &ndash; has been very welcome. And the support of Cotswold Wildlife Park, which quarantined the original Polish birds and continues to manage and cover the costs of the captive-breeding programme using its own well- trained staff and excellent facilities, has proved invaluable.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">E</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Across Europe, as stork populations have suffered from the draining of wetlands and disappearance of insect-rich pastures and meadows, their loss has been felt deeply. A few years ago, a tearful old woman in a village in Belarus showed me the nest on her roof, empty of storks for the first time in living memory. Where storks have been reintroduced, they are greeted with great happiness and some historical stork festivals have been restored. The Spanish erect poles for nests along their motorways, and in Alsace householders install cartwheels for storks to build nests on their roofs. During a cold snap in Bulgaria last March, villagers even gave white storks access to their homes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">F</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A driving motivation behind the project in the UK is the aspiration that the storks&rsquo; return will spark feelings of empathy and affection from townspeople who see their nests on rooftops. They might also encourage the public to feel worried about the wider area where they fly off to feed on earthworms, grasshoppers and frogs. White storks could be that charismatic species that connects urban communities directly with landscape restoration. Certainly, people once loved them here. The name of our local village, Storrington, was originally &lsquo;Estorcheton&rsquo; or &lsquo;home of the storks&rsquo;. The public response has been overwhelming, with crowds coming to see white storks flying free in England for the first time in hundreds of years, and private landowners queueing up to offer more introduction sites. The flight of the white stork over Britain is the triumph of practical action over bureaucracy, self-interest and negativity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 34-37<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the summary below.

Once you&rsquo;ve devised a program, continue to assess the outcomes and regularly survey your team to gather feedback.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Focus on general prevention<br></span><span class="c0">Consider offering flu vaccinations on site and look at offering employees incentives on health insurance. Some companies arrange for someone who specialises in health issues, such as a doctor, to visit the workplace and speak to employees.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Encourage a healthier diet<br></span><span class="c0">Most of us know that eating healthily can help prevent future diseases, but many are not aware that unhealthy eating is linked to a 66 percent increased risk of loss of productivity. It may be necessary to consciously develop a healthy food and drink workplace policy, including a healthy catering policy. A simple thing to do is substitute soda in any on-site vending machines with water or juice. Also investigate the nutritional value of food supplied for team meetings and work events. Consider putting a bowl of fruit out in the staff room and urge everyone to help themselves for free. You can encourage employees to bring in healthy lunches from home by making sure that there is a fridge in the break room.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Encourage more exercise<br></span><span class="c0">Encouraging employees to exercise needn&rsquo;t be expensive as there are plenty of low-cost methods available. These might include: installing racks for bikes in your staff car park; encouraging employees to take part in fun runs and charity events; suggesting &lsquo;walking meetings&rsquo; where people discuss business as they get fresh air and exercise; and putting in showers to assist those who ride or run to the workplace. Some companies negotiate group rates for their employees at a nearby gym.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Improve mental health<br></span><span class="c0">Recent reports have shown that ignoring mental health costs Australian companies at least $11 billion a year. We all have a responsibility to look out for one another. Some ways you can do this in the workplace include: running employee surveys to get valuable information on morale in the workplace; training managers on mental health strategies; offering rebates so employees are compensated for counselling if required; and refusing to accept any bullying and unprofessional behaviour in your workplace.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 15-21<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the notes below.

Later, a woman from Sussex, England, revived the nostalgic brand and brought it up to date</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t remember many of the clothes I wore before I was six, but I have a vivid memory of a certain skirt whose patterns I can still trace in my mind. It was wraparound, with a belt that threaded through itself, decorated with cats in two shades of green. I wore it with a knitted red jersey my mum bought in a jumble sale, and brown sandals with flowers cut into the toes. It was 1979, and I was not yet five. I forgot about that skirt for a long time, but when a girlfriend mentioned the name Clothkits while we were chatting, it was as if a door suddenly opened on a moment in the past that resonated with vivid significance for me.&rsquo; The brand, founded in 1968, had by the late 1980s mostly vanished from people&rsquo;s lives, but by a combination of determination and luck Kay Mawer brought it back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">B</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Clothkits was created by the designer Anne Kennedy, who came up with the ingenious idea of printing a pattern straight on to coloured fabric so that a paper pattern was not needed. It was accompanied by instructions that almost anyone could follow on how to cut the pieces out and sew them together. &lsquo;I was rebelling against the formulaic lines of textile design at that time,&rsquo; Kennedy says. &lsquo;My interest was in folk art and clothes that were simple to make as I had lots of unfinished sewing disasters in my cupboard.&rsquo; Clothkits has always embodied the spirit of the late 1960s and 1970s. Its initial design was a dress in a geometric stripe in orange, pink, turquoise and purple. It cost 25 shillings (&pound;1.25), and after it was featured in the Observer newspaper, Kennedy received more than &pound;2,000 worth of orders. She ran the company from Lewes in Sussex, where at its peak it employed more than 400 people, selling to 44 countries worldwide. Sew-your-own kits formed the core of the business, supplemented by knitwear. Kennedy&rsquo;s children demonstrated the patterns by wearing them in photographs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">C</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Kennedy sold the company in the late 1980s. There had been a few administrative problems with postal strikes and a new computer system, which back then took up an entire room, &lsquo;but the times were changing as well,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;More women were going out to work and sewing less for their children.&rsquo; She sold the company to one of her suppliers, who then sold it on to Freeman&rsquo;s, which ran Clothkits alongside its own brand for a while, using Kennedy&rsquo;s impressive database, but its ethos are big, corporate company did not sit well alongside the alternative and artistic of Clothkits. In 1991, Clothkits was made dormant, and there the story may have ended, were it not for Mawer&rsquo;s fascination with discovering what happened Clothkits.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">D</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Mawer&rsquo;s mother bought her a sewing machine when she was ten and taught her basic pattern-cutting and garment construction, encouraging her to experiment with colour and design by trial and error. The first garment Mawer made was a pair of trousers, which she made by tracing around an existing pair of trousers. In her late twenties, she spent five years working on digital and sculptural installations. &lsquo;It was an amazing, mind-expanding experience, but I knew it was unlikely I could make a living as a practising artist. I was definitely looking for a way that I could work in a creative industry with a commercial edge.&rsquo; The experience inspired Mawer to return to education, studying for a degree in fine art at the University of Chichester. Her passion for vintage fabric, which her mother had encouraged her to start collecting, led her back to Clothkits, and from there to a journey into the heart of Freeman&rsquo;s. Negotiations with the company took 18 months, but in October 2007 Clothkits was hers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">E</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The ethos of Clothkits remains the same, and Mawer is proud that her fabric is printed either in London or the north of England, and that packaging is kept to an absolute minimum. &lsquo;I wanted to feel that everyone involved in the brand, from design to production, was part of a process I could witness. I couldn&rsquo;t see the point of manufacturing on the other side of the world, as that&rsquo;s not what Clothkits has ever been about.&rsquo; The revival of Clothkits has also, of course, coincided with a growing sense of dissatisfaction at our disposable society, and the resulting resurgence of interest in skills such as sewing and knitting. &lsquo;Making your own clothes gives you a greater appreciation of the craftsmanship in the construction of a garment,&rsquo; Mawer says. &lsquo;When you know the process involved in making a skirt, you treasure it in a way you wouldn&rsquo;t if you&rsquo;d bought it from a mass- producing manufacturer.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 28-31<br></span><span class="c0">The text has five paragraphs, A-E.

There is a small gift shop for unusual souvenirs, and a kiosk that rents stand-up paddleboards. Buses do not stop nearby so a walk is necessary.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">B North Steyne<br></span><span class="c0">This popular beach is a little further from the ferry than the main beach and it always feels less crowded. North Steyne has professional lifeguards on duty, but the surf can be hazardous so check conditions if swimming with young ones. If you want to try surfing for the first time, Manly Surf School operates out of the surf club located on the beach. Please note that boards are reserved for students and are not available for rent.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">C Delwood<br></span><span class="c0">Delwood&rsquo;s secluded cove is a scenic walk from the ferry along the harbour walkway. There are no shops, so bring a picnic and have a peaceful swim off the rocks. You&rsquo;ll probably have the beach to yourself.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">D Little Manly<br></span><span class="c0">This popular harbour beach has a net that encloses the swimming area. It is a good option for families as the protected area makes it easy to keep an eye on kids playing in the water. There is also a large playground, a public barbecue that anyone can use and toilet facilities, which make this a great spot for a family day out.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">E East Esplanade<br></span><span class="c0">Located next to Manly Wharf, East Esplanade is a popular spot all day. There is no beach closer to the ferry or buses than this one. Kayakers meet for a paddle here as the sun rises, and daytrippers sit on the sand during the day. People get together on the grass after work, and bring drinks, snacks and music to watch the sun go down.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">F Shelly Beach<br></span><span class="c0">This is the best spot if you don&rsquo;t like big waves. Rent a beach chair or head straight to the Boathouse Cafe, the perfect place for breakfast or lunch. Please note that Shelly Beach gets overly crowded at times, so avoid it on a sunny weekend afternoon.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 1-7<br></span><span class="c0">Look at the six beach descriptions, A-F.

However, car parking provision is limited. DG Contracts therefore actively encourages staff to reduce their carbon footprint by using public transport, walking or cycling, or by organising ways of sharing the use of cars.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The car parking policy aims to allocate parking on a fair and equitable basis with spaces being given first to those employees who claim above a certain mileage of travel for business purposes. Individuals who are allocated a parking space will be issued with a parking permit and a number which corresponds to a car parking space. If there are any non-allocated car parking spaces, these can be utilised by employees on a first-come, first-served basis. In some cases, designated parking areas are required for company vehicles, which must be parked securely at night. However, employees may park in these areas in the daytime.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If any individual leaves the company prior to the expiry of their parking permit, this will be handed on to the member of staff who acts as their replacement, assuming that this person requires it. If any individual who has been issued a parking permit takes maternity leave or is signed off work for a lengthy period, their parking permit will be reallocated to the staff member appointed as cover for this individual during their absence.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Employees who park their cars in a DG company car park do so at their own risk and must follow the rules laid down in the parking policy. If you have any complaints concerning any aspect of car parking at DG company car parks, please address them to the HR Manager.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 15-20<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the sentences below.

However, a surprising number of hazards can also be present in the office.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The most common types of injuries are slips, trips and falls. Boxes, files and other items piled in walkways can create a tripping hazard. Be certain that all materials are safely stored in their proper location to prevent build-up of clutter. Further, in addition to posing an electrical hazard, stretching wires across walkways creates a tripping hazard, so ensure they are properly secured and covered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Standing on rolling office chairs is a significant fall hazard. Workers who need to reach something at an elevated height should use a stepladder, which must be fully opened and placed on level ground.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Workers can collide when making turns in the hallways and around blind corners. This can be prevented by installing mirrors in these places so workers can see who is coming. Floors may also present a hazard. Marble or tile can become very slippery, particularly when wet. The use of carpets can help to reduce falls and can be especially helpful at main doors, where workers are likely to be coming in with wet shoes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Another type of injury comes from workers being struck by an object. Filing cabinets may be in danger of tipping over if drawers are left open, and filing cabinets and desks may also create a tripping hazard if they are not properly closed. High piles of materials and equipment can cause major injuries if they are knocked over. Heavy objects should always be stored close to the ground, and the load capacity of shelves should never be exceeded.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because office workers spend most of their day seated at a desk, they are prone to strains and other injuries related to posture and repetitive movement. Desks, seating, monitor stands, etc. should all be adjustable in order to accommodate the widest possible range of employees. Typing from hard copy can lead to neck strain if a worker is forced to look down repeatedly to the desk at the document being copied and back to the computer screen.

Building upon more ancient routes and creating a huge number of new ones Roman engineers were fearless in their plans to join one point to another in as straight line as possible whatever the difficulties in geography and the costs in manpower. Consequently roads required bridges tunnels, viaducts and many other architectural and engineering features to create a series of breathtaking but highly useful monuments which spread from Europe to eastern parts of the Roman Empire.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">B</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The Romans did not invent roads, but as in so many other areas, they took an idea which went back as far as the Bronze Age and extended that concept daring to squeeze from it the fullest possible potential. The first and most famous great Roman road was the Via Appia or Appian Way. Constructed from 312 BCE and covering 196 kilometers it linked Rome to ancient Capua in Italy in as straight a line as possible and was appropriately known to the Romans as the Regina Viarum or &lsquo;Queen of Roads&rsquo;. Much like a modern highway it bypassed small towns along the way and it largely ignored geographical obstacles. The road would later be extended to 569 kilometers in length.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">C</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The network of public Roman roads covered over 120,000 kilometers. Besides permitting the rapid deployment of troops and more importantly the wheeled vehicles which supplied them with food and equipment, Roman roads allowed for an increase in trade and cultural exchange. Roads were also one of the ways Rome could demonstrate its authority. For this reason, many roads began and ended in a triumphal arch, and the imperial prestige associated with a road project was demonstrated in the fact that roads were very often named after the officials who funded them; for example, the Via Appia takes its name from the Roman magistrate Appius Claudius Caecus.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">D</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;To achieve the objective of constructing the shortest routes possible between two points, all manner of engineering difficulties had to be overcome. Once extensive surveying had been carried out, to ensure the proposed route was actually straight and to determine what various engineering methods were needed, marshes had to be drained, forests cut through, creeks diverted, bedrock channelled, mountainsides cut into rivers crossed with bridges, valleys traversed with viaducts and tunnels built through mountains. When all that was done, roads had to be levelled, reinforced with support walls or terracing and then, of course, maintained which they were for over 800 years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">E</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Major roads were around a standard 4.2 metres wide, which was enough space for two vehicles to pass each other. First a trench was dug in the earth, and a layer of large stones was used to form the foundation. This was followed by a substantial deposit of smaller broken materials &ndash; often crushed brick was used for this purpose, and on top of this, a layer of fine gravel was added. This upper section of the road was referred to as the nucleus and was then surfaced with blocks or slabs. Mountain roads might also have ridges running across the surface of the slabs, to give animals better grip, and have ruts cut into the stone to guide wheeled vehicles.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Roads were purposely inclined slightly from the centre down to the kerb to allow rainwater to run off along the sides. Many also had parallel ditches that collected the runoff and formed a drainage canal on each side of the road. A path of packed gravel for pedestrians typically ran along each side of the road, varying in width from 1 to 3 metres. Separating the path from the road were the kerb stones, which were regular upright slabs. Busier stretches of main roads had areas where vehicles could pull over, and some of these had services for travellers and their animals. Milestones were also set up at regular intervals along the road and these often recorded who was responsible for the upkeep of that stretch of the road and what repairs had been made.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">F</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Lasting symbols of the imagination of Roman engineers are the many arched bridges and viaducts still standing today that helped achieve the engineers&rsquo; straight-line goal. The Romans built to last, and the piers of bridges which crossed rivers, for example, were often built with a resistant prow-shape and used massive durable blocks of stone, while the upper parts might be built of stone blocks strengthened with iron clamps. Perhaps the most impressive bridge was at Narni; 180 metres long, 8 metres wide and as high as 33 metres, it had 4 massive semicircular arches, one of which, stretching 32.1 metres, ranks as one of the longest block-arch spans in the ancient world. Recently hit by earthquakes, it is now having to undergo restoration work to repair the effects.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Such was the engineering and surveying skill of the Romans that many of their roads have provided the basis for hundreds of today&rsquo;s routes across Europe and the Middle East. Many roads in Italy still use the original Roman name for certain stretches, and some bridges, such as at Tre Ponti in Venice, still carry road traffic today.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 28-33<br></span><span class="c0">The text has six sections, A-F.

Here is a selection of machines that could change your mind</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A Magimix Gelato Expert<br></span><span class="c0">If you&rsquo;re an ice cream fanatic, it doesn&rsquo;t get better than this. It&rsquo;s quick, taking as little as 20 minutes, and consistent in its results, while the three automated programmes are very easy to use and it has an unusually generous two-litre capacity. On the other hand, we found it noisier than many, and the ice cream is softer than we might have liked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">B Shake n Make Ice Cream Maker<br></span><span class="c0">If you want to make some basic soft ice cream, this is a fun little gadget that gets decent results. You add a little ice and salt to the base, then your ingredients to the stainless-steel tub, pop the lid on and give it a good shake for at least three minutes. Provided you measure everything exactly and shake back and forth consistently, it&rsquo;s surprisingly efficient.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">C Sage Smart Scoop<br></span><span class="c0">This is a seriously smart machine. Our favourite feature is the built-in sensor that works out whether the consistency of your ice cream or frozen yoghurt is right for you (from the 12 hardness settings) so that it can stop mixing when it&rsquo;s ready, alerting you with a fun tune. As you&rsquo;d expect from the considerable price tag, there&rsquo;s a built-in freezer and it feels beautifully engineered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">D Lakeland Digital Ice Cream Maker<br></span><span class="c0">You simply pop on the lid and pour in the ingredients, then set the timer using the nice, clear digital display. Some customers reportedly struggled to disassemble it in order to wash the bowl and paddle, but we didn&rsquo;t have that problem. We&rsquo;re also giving it extra points for the recipe book, which has some really tasty ideas.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">E Judge Ice Cream Maker<br></span><span class="c0">We had a few criticisms, perhaps not surprisingly when you consider this is one of the cheapest models in our selection &ndash; notably the fact that the paddle isn&rsquo;t as robust as the ones in other models. We&rsquo;d have liked more recipes, too. But, for a budget machine, this is a bargain.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">F KitchenAid Artisan Ice Cream Maker<br></span><span class="c0">If you own a KitchenAid food mixer, this attachment (one of 15 that fits this machine) is a good way to start ice cream making. You simply freeze the bowl before use and attach it to the mixer (a quick and easy job) and pour in your favourite fresh ingredients, with some recipes taking just 20 minutes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 1-7<br></span><span class="c0">Look at the six advertisements for ice cream makers, A-F. For which ice cream maker are the following statements true?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">1. Users of this machine will need to put some physical effort into making ice cream.<br>2. Users of this machine can decide how soft they want their ice cream to be.<br>3. This ice cream maker can be fixed onto an existing kitchen appliance.<br>4. It is possible to make a larger amount of ice cream at one time than in most other machines.<br>5. This machine has features that make it worth the high price.<br>6.

Common health effects from breathing hazardous substances include sore eyes and headaches. Make sure you are using the right RPE for the task. For example, negative pressure respirators should not be used in low oxygen environments.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Some types of RPE must have a tight seal around the facial area to be effective. Your employer will arrange a yearly facial fit test to ensure that you are given RPE that fits properly. This checks that the seal between the respirator and the facial area is secure, by releasing a substance that you can smell or taste if the RPE is not working properly. RPE will only provide effective protection if you are clean shaven. Facial hair growth makes it almost impossible to get a good seal so, if you have a beard, you should talk to your employer about other forms of RPE that do not rely on a tight facial fit. Jewellery and long hair can also compromise an effective fit.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Using your RPE<br></span><span class="c0">You should complete a visual check of your RPE for signs of damage before you use it. If you are using RPE that requires a tight fit, you must check it fits properly before entering a hazardous area.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Cleaning your RPE<br></span><span class="c0">Wash and dry your RPE after using it. Use a mild detergent, as harsh products such as solvents can cause damage. Use a brush and warm water and rinse with clean water. This will remove excess detergent that can cause skin irritation. Dry your RPE on a solid wooden rack or suspend from a clothes line.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Maintaining your RPE<br></span><span class="c0">Inspect your RPE after each use and during cleaning. Make sure you check the straps for breaks, tears, fraying edges and deterioration of elasticity. Check the inhalation and exhalation valves are working and not damaged.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Storing your RPE<br></span><span class="c0">Improper storage can cause distortion to your RPE. Store your RPE in a clean, dry plQGe, QWay from dust, oil and sunlight. RPE should be stored so that it doesn&rsquo;t get crushed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 15-21<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the sentences below.

They often happen when working with cows in a dairy during milking, and during maintenance and cleaning.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The following three hazards make it more likely that employees will slip or trip:<br>1. Surfaces which are wet or dirty<br>&bull; Have a system for cleaning up milk, oil, cleaning fluid and grain spills as soon as it happen, and make sure it is followed.<br>&bull; Install non-slip mats in wet work areas and make sure that footwear is slip-resistant.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">2. Obstacles such as pipes or cables in the farm dairy<br>&bull; Reduce tripping accidents by hanging hoses and pipes along walls out of people&rsquo;s way and remove unused fittings, like bolt fasteners in floors.<br>&bull; Move obstacles from walkways and entrances where possible. Tripping hazards which cannot be removed should be clearly indicated with yellow tape.

The days shorten appreciably as winter approaches and the last autumn leaves are blown free by high winds and frequent rain. Nature seems dormant, as many birds have long since flown to warmer climates, fungi break through the earth, and many animal species sleep until spring&rsquo;s warm awakening.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It would seem a good time also to put the camera to bed and forget about photography until the first snowfall. Well, not quite. With the days being shorter and daylight less bright, November is an excellent month to turn your attention to what can be found in the long darkness from dusk to dawn. In the nocturnal hours a vast number of life forms still thrive, and provide a completely different set of subjects to those the daylight hours present.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">B</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;As the most noticeable object in the night sky, the moon is an obvious subject when making your initial attempts at night photography. The timing of an evening moonrise is important to know because, not only does it vary according to the time of year, but the moon always appears largest at this point, when it is closest to the horizon. To capture the moon at its brilliant best, you need a bit of luck too: a time when its brightest phase &ndash; a full moon &ndash; coincides with the ideal weather forecast of a cloudless night sky. The moon is not a direct light source such as the sun or the stars; instead it is reflecting the light of the sun hitting its surface. On such a night, a full moon will reflect only about ten percent of the sunlight, but that is still enough to illuminate buildings, trees, bridges and other landscape features.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">C</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;With today&rsquo;s cameras, far greater detail can be rendered. Whole constellations consisting of thousands of points of starlight filling the frame and even galaxies such as our own Milky Way can be captured. This is a type of night photography for which few of us had suitable equipment a decade ago, but now it has become accessible to all photographers, thanks to the much improved, affordable technology.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, photographers choosing to shoot the moon may be less concerned by this, as they tend to prefer to use telephoto lenses to magnify the size of the moon, particularly when it is low in the sky and can be shown in relation to a landmark or recognisable structure within the frame.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">D</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Of course, the nocturnal world offers other subjects closer to the ground, some that are even familiar to us by day. As cities and towns spread further into our green spaces, some wild animals move further afield to escape our intrusions, while others adapt to their new urbanised surroundings.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In European cities, sightings of foxes at night are increasingly common, as they thrive thanks to the cover of darkness and a ready supply of residents&rsquo; waste bins, which they use as feeding stations. Deer and wild boar are larger mammals that have also adapted to the urban fringes in recent years, emerging from the cover of parks and nearby forests to forage into residential gardens by night.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">E</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Such is the proliferation of urban wildlife that some photographers now specialise in documenting the nocturnal animals that have developed a taste for city nightlife. The improvement in camera technology that has made night sky images more accessible has also extended the creative repertoire of the wildlife photographer. It is now possible to photograph some wild species at night, or soon after dusk, without having to always resort to the use of specialist equipment. More exciting still is how the techniques of astro-photography and the wildlife camera-trap have combined in recent years, to produce images of nocturnal animals against a background of a star-studded night sky. This marriage of two photographic genres has created an innovative style of night photography.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">F</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;If that all sounds a bit too complex and time-consuming, with too many variables to spoil the hoped-for result, then consider using the fading light of the night sky in the brief time after dusk in a more opportunistic manner. Dusk is the part of the nocturnal phase when the light of the sun is still visible, though the sun itself has disappeared completely. During the earliest phase of dusk there is enough ambient light remaining to enable features in our surroundings to be seen without the aid of artificial light sources such as floodlights or street lamps.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">G</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;While many of us shoot sunsets, the period of dusk also provides an opportunity to use the ambient light low in the sky as a backdrop to photographing foreground subjects in varying stages of illumination, or even as shadowy outlines against the fading sky. The variety of possible subjects includes ships at sea, flocks of low-flying birds, trees, windmills, skyscrapers and high bridges. These are all well known by day, but against a night sky at dusk they lack colour, so any compositional strength is determined by the graphic appeal of their distinct and recognisable shapes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 35-40<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the sentences below.

Timetables are reviewed in October and March, and may alter slightly so check before you travel. Our first tram from the city centre leaves from Marvin Square at 6.30 am, half an hour after the first city bus service.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Can I get a tram from the airport?<br></span><span class="c0">Trams from the airport to the city centre start running at 6.15 am and leave every fifteen minutes until 7.30 pm when the evening schedule takes over. Trams then run to the main railway station at 35-minute intervals and end at 11.35 pm. If your flight arrives later than this, the number 207 airport bus runs every hour through the night.</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"><br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What do I do if I don&rsquo;t have a ticket?<br></span><span class="c0">Tickets are not sold by anyone on the tram. Ticket vending machines are located at all tram shelters. Check your route and make sure you buy the correct price ticket. If the vending machine does not work, you should push the red button on the machine and speak into the microphone. A member of staff will either fix the machine straight away or contact the tram inspector onboard your tram. He or she cannot sell you a ticket, but you will not be obliged to pay the &pound;8 on-board fine for not having one.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Can I take my bike on the tram?<br></span><span class="c0">Each tram is licensed to carry a maximum of two bicycles, though drivers may refuse to allow cyclists to get on if the tram is crowded. Bicycles may only be taken on the trams during off-peak travel periods: up to 7.30 am, between 10 am and 2.30 pm and after 7 pm. Festivals and other large events may also mean that bicycles are prohibited as trams carry extra passengers at these times. Once on board, riders should remain with their bicycles throughout the journey and ensure they do not obstruct the entrance, exit or any other area of public access.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 1-7<br></span><span class="c0">Do the following statements agree with the information given in the text?

It&rsquo;s a long sweater but that&rsquo;s good as I&rsquo;m quite tall. I normally find that the sleeves are too short when I try on a top, but not with this one. I tend to take medium but went for large, which was a wise decision as there is plenty of room for a T-shirt underneath when I wear it with jeans.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">B Davina<br></span><span class="c0">These sweaters are an ideal weight for office wear. The purple one is pretty, though I expected a lighter shade from the picture. I wear a US size 12 / UK 16, and the medium is big enough to fit over a shirt with room to spare. It has long sleeves that I love to roll up at the wrist. I&rsquo;m now trying to resist the temptation to buy it in grey too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">C Naga<br></span><span class="c0">This knitted sweater looks great in the pictures. I ordered the olive green with stripes and, although I wasn&rsquo;t sure it was going to look right on me, I was pleasantly surprised when I put it on. It&rsquo;s very soft and I love the long past-the-wrist sleeves too. I opted for the medium, but it was too tight so I exchanged it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">D Libby<br></span><span class="c0">This is the third of your sweaters that I&rsquo;ve bought over the past two years.

Here&rsquo;s how to inspire your team:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Set the tone of your leadership style from the outset. Be confident, self-assured and respectful with everyone you meet. Speak as you want to be spoken to, and remember to listen. The first few weeks is when people develop their perceptions of you, so work hard to earn their trust. This will be key to effective change and progress.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Part of a leader&rsquo;s brief is to set bold goals. They could take years to achieve, but they need to be specific enough that everyone in the organisation understands them, buys into them and is willing to work together to achieve them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Don&rsquo;t do everything yourself. Great leaders surround themselves with talented individuals and they should trust them to make things happen. If things need changing, tell people and involve them in making the changes by participating in the design of a new strategy. If the team is too cautious to embrace change, give them one more chance but be clearer about what you want.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stamp out the &lsquo;them and us&rsquo; culture. In many organisations, employees feel distant from senior management. The message must be plain: we all work together, but leaders need to work hard to ensure this filters through to everyone in the organisation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Allow time for innovation. It&rsquo;s important to give staff time to come up with new ideas and solutions that will fix new problems. However, be clear that a decision is expected; set a time limit and stick to it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is likely that the formula that makes the business you are managing successful will have been created many years ago &ndash; but it&rsquo;s important to remember how the business started. Honour those early pioneers and instil a sense of pride across the organisation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leaders need to accept that some risk may be required if the situation calls for it. Playing it safe is never a good business rule, and leaders must make sure their business stays ahead by being prepared to act quickly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Show you are passionate and enthusiastic. People spend a large part of their lives working for an organisation, and having a leader who is genuinely thrilled about its future is hugely inspiring.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 15-21<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the sentences below.

This is one of the few constants about it. But it&rsquo;s arguably changing at a faster rate now than at any previous moment in its history. And emojis &ndash; the set of picture characters that people use to punctuate their online correspondence &ndash; are at the forefront of this frenzy for change.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As a form of global communication, emojis only began their growth in 2011. Four years later, it was estimated that they were being used by over 90 per cent of the online population. In excess of six billion were being sent every day. Their prevalence in the culture was such that Oxford Dictionaries recently chose one as their word of the year. &lsquo;Words of the Year&rsquo; are those judged to be reflective of the &lsquo;ethos, mood, or preoccupations of that particular year&rsquo;. They&rsquo;re very much of their time. And often, once that time has passed, they fade from people&rsquo;s consciousness almost as quickly as they arose.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s a good chance, then, that the emoji chosen by Oxford Dictionaries &ndash; the &lsquo;face with tears of joy&rsquo; &ndash; will also appear to be dated in a few years. But the reasons for this offer a fascinating insight into the way that society is evolving. The little yellow circle with dots for eyes acts as a surprisingly good lens through which to view the history of human communication, and to predict its future.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">B</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;There are two main reasons why language changes. One is to do with the way that language mirrors the changes in how we relate to each other. As an expression of identity, language is adapted by different groups and different generations to reflect their own sense of self. It also needs to constantly assimilate fresh concepts as these evolve.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Words are being created for these reasons all the time. But what&rsquo;s interesting about emojis is that they&rsquo;ve contributed to this ever-expanding storehouse in a different way. At this point in our history, the gaps in our vocabulary are being filled not simply by new words, but by an absolutely new system of expression.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">C</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The second major reason that language changes is down to technology &ndash; specifically, the ways in which the technologies we use have an effect on the process of communication itself. Both hardware and new technologies result in us subtly changing the way we interact with each other and also altering the shape of the language we use.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Emojis have evolved as a solution to the needs of mobile communication. In particular, they compensate for the way that computer-mediated messaging on smartphones can sometimes tend towards the emotionally empty. Whereas face- to-face, or even voice-to-voice, conversations can express emotional closeness through facial expression or tone of voice, this is easy to miss when messages are rendered in a few short words on a small screen. Emojis are a means of restoring this emotional framing to an interaction &ndash; punctuating your message with a smile.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">D</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;But unlike almost any other type of language system, emojis have something akin to a built-in obsolescence. Just as smartphones and their operating systems have a frequent refresh rate, emojis also get routine enhancements. The emojis you have on your phone now will undergo subtle redesigns over the course of time, and extra characters will be added. Because of this, their usefulness is artificially limited.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the context of communication systems, this is something that&rsquo;s never previously been the case. Twenty years ago, people might have bought a new landline phone when they were tired of the design of their old phone or if they wanted to get one with whatever latest innovation was going around &ndash; an inbuilt answering machine, say. But they didn&rsquo;t have to upgrade the language they were using as well.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Emojis, on the other hand, are a case study of how technology and the human capacity for communication are working together-of how the onward march of technology exists at the intersection of consumerism, innovation and design. Moreover, the fact that they&rsquo;re at the front line of a relentless wave of technologically driven change in communications practices encourages &ndash; if not necessitates &ndash; a great amount of creativity in the way they&rsquo;re used.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">E</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Finally, there&rsquo;s the way they&rsquo;ve become implicated in almost all aspects of modern society, from politics and marketing to art and entertainment. Emojis are the subject of musicals and Hollywood films. They&rsquo;re the inspiration for fashion design, art and architecture. They&rsquo;re a staple in advertising and commerce. Understanding why they&rsquo;ve become so popular, and how they work, can not only explain something about the nature of language; it can also help us to understand our relationship with technology, society and ourselves.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 33-37<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the summary below.

Despite its limited facilities, the site, with its large tent pitches, is an ideal base for exploring the area and driving to the rock museum, the craft workshops or Gaydon Castle. Just follow the signs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">B Newgammon Wild<br></span><span class="c0">This campsite looks like it&rsquo;s going to be a winner. It only opened last year, but already the website has some very positive reviews from the handful of campers who know about it so far. It offers splendid views over some of the country&rsquo;s most attractive beaches, which can be accessed by steep, narrow cliff steps. You need a good level of fitness for these, and don&rsquo;t forget to leave some energy for the return trip at the end of the day.</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"><br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">C Oakerly Estate<br></span><span class="c0">You won&rsquo;t be disappointed when you reach Oakerly, despite the problems of getting there by car on such narrow roads. You&rsquo;ll see quite a lot of motorhomes when you hit the clifftop, but there&rsquo;s still plenty of room for tents on the spacious lawn that also offers a camp kitchen, restaurant and bar. Make sure you stay safe and pitch your tent within the white line around the cliff edge, though.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">D South Turnbull<br></span><span class="c0">The emphasis at this site is on back-to-basics camping. It&rsquo;s advisable to come in a group as there are few facilities and you need to do all your own cooking. The area is rather exposed, and in periods of bad weather it can&rsquo;t be reached at all so check on the website before you go.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">E Boxer Trepis<br></span><span class="c0">The 20-metre high rockfaces that surround this site are especially attractive to rock climbers, who come here to camp from hundreds of miles away so that they can attempt the climb &ndash; and not always with success, according to the website! It&rsquo;s not compulsory, of course, and there are plenty of other activities for campers to get involved in, such as birdwatching and bathing in the sea.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 1-7<br></span><span class="c0">Look at the five descriptions of campsites, A-E.

For those interested in the work, here is what a typical day could be like for a trained care worker</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Care workers often start early, as the first client of the day may need help getting out of bed and putting on their clothes; they may suffer from a condition that prevents them from doing this easily. Providing these services helps clients to look and feel as good as possible when beginning their day. The care worker may then help to cook breakfast for the client, and this is often a good time to enjoy a conversation and catch up on how they are feeling. Many clients appreciate being able to chat to someone regularly, as some may have no family members or friends living nearby. Next, the care worker may take the opportunity to do some basic housework for the client. Housework is often something that elderly people or people with disabilities may not be able to do themselves. Even something as simple as hoovering the living room can make a huge difference to a client&rsquo;s day. Of course, there may be the breakfast dishes to do as well.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Later in the morning, the care worker may move on to another client in order to help them prepare their midday meal. Care workers try to ensure this is healthy because it is so important to keep clients fit and well. When that&rsquo;s finished, the care worker may help the client to carry out their shopping by going with them to the local supermarket.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">During the afternoon, a care worker may help a third client with an outdoor activity, which could involve going for a short walk in the local area or taking the laundry to the launderette. Elderly people may not feel confident going far on their own, so having company can be a great help.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The care worker may participate in cooking dinner with their last client and, before going home, they may also get out their client&rsquo;s medication. This ensures the client remembers to take it before going to bed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 15-20<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the flowchart below.

But how can it be achieved?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The first step is to take a serious look at the amount of time you are devoting to work and set about reducing it. The main benefit most people notice once they stop working too much is an improvement in their general health and wellbeing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Tips for a healthy work-life balance<br></span><span class="c0">A recent study showed office workers spend approximately 1,700 hours a year in front of a computer. Ensure that your workstation is set up so you&rsquo;re as comfortable as possible and this will help to minimise the chance of any injuries.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Whether it&rsquo;s making a hot drink, going for a walk or simply chatting with a colleague, regular breaks are vital. Your brain needs a break roughly every 90 minutes or concentration declines, leaving you with difficulty focusing and feeling sleepy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Setting goals for both your professional and persona! life is great. Remember though, to make these realistic, because setting an unattainable goal is the quickest way to damage your confidence.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Activities such as sports and gymnastics are known to decrease tension and increase endurance, two important factors towards achieving a healthy work-life balance. They also boost your belief that you can do whatever you are faced with.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sometimes it&rsquo;s easier said than done, but if you&rsquo;re juggling numerous pieces of work on a daily basis, learning to prioritise is key. Try to break down your work into various categories, depending on how urgent and important each piece of work is. This will help you to plan your day and achieve more.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ensure you have time to do the things that make you happy. If you&rsquo;ve got nothing nice to look forward to and can only see a long line of work days ahead of you, this can easily become overwhelming and ultimately hinder your productivity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s there for a reason and there are no prizes for giving it up, so make sure you take your annual holiday entitlement. You don&rsquo;t have to be going on an exotic foreign trip &ndash; maybe you just fancy a rest day watching films or you want to take some time off to spend with a friend you don&rsquo;t see enough.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Family, friends and favourite pets are the ultimate life enhancers. From evenings out to simply taking a walk in the sunshine, spending time with the ones you love is the best way to unwind fully and feel the effects of a good work-life balance.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 21-27<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the sentences below.

Only a few cities in the world, notably Amsterdam, have managed to cut child obesity. As in Amsterdam, the decline in Leeds is most marked among families living in the most deprived areas, where the problem is worst and hardest to tackle.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;The improvement in the most deprived children in Leeds is startling,&rsquo; said Susan Jebb, a professor of diet and population health at Oxford University, whose team has analysed the city&rsquo;s data. Over four years, obesity has dropped from 11.5% to 10.5% and the trajectory is steadily downwards. Among the more affluent families, there was also a decline from 6.8% to 6%. Overall the drop was from 9.4% to 8.8%. The data comes from the national child measurement programme (NCMP), which requires all children to be weighed at the start and end of primary school. The biggest decline in obesity in Leeds is 6.4% in the reception class, at about the age of four.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No such data has been reported elsewhere in the UK, where childhood obesity is a major concern. The measurement programme shares the progress made in each city with those considered comparable. For Leeds, the 15 closest &lsquo;neighbours&rsquo; at the start of its study period in 2009 were Sheffield, Kirklees, Bristol, Newcastle upon Tyne, Coventry, Bolton, Wakefield, Derby, Bradford, Dudley, Medway, Liverpool, Swindon, County Durham and Warrington. The obesity rates there and across the country have not shifted. Susan Jebb added that the dropping rate in Leeds appeared to be a trend. &lsquo;This is four years, not one rogue data point,&rsquo; she said at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow where she presented the research.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jebb, a former government adviser, says they cannot be sure what has turned the tide in Leeds &ndash; but it could involve a programme called &lsquo;Henry&rsquo; that the city introduced as the core of its obesity strategy in 2009, focusing particularly on the youngest children and poorest families. &lsquo;Henry&rsquo; (Health, Exercise, Nutrition for the Really Young) supports parents in setting boundaries for their children and taking a positive stance on issues from healthy eating to bedtimes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Henry&rsquo;s&rsquo; chief executive, Kim Roberts, said the drop in obesity in Leeds was &lsquo;unprecedented &hellip; The indicators are that this isn&rsquo;t happening in other cities&rsquo;. The programme encourages authoritative rather than authoritarian parenting, she said. &lsquo;Authoritarian parenting is when children are told what to eat and what to do, such as being banned from leaving the table until they have eaten their sprouts,&rsquo; said Roberts. &lsquo;Permissive parenting is asking children what they want to do. But &lsquo;Henry&rsquo; encourages a third approach known as authoritative parenting, where parents make it clear they are in charge, but also respond to their children.&rsquo; Instead of being asked what vegetable they want with dinner, children might be asked whether they would like carrots or broccoli. Instead of being told to go to bed, they are asked where they want to read their story beforehand.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lisa, who joined a &lsquo;Henry&rsquo; parenting course when her oldest daughter was two, is enthusiastic about her family&rsquo;s experience of the programme. She learned a lot about healthy eating, saved money by planning meals and lost two stone herself. &lsquo;I think it made me a better parent because of all the parenting skills stuff. I was able to share some of the ideas with my partner and as a result the kids became calmer and happier, which helped us fee! less stressed too,&rsquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Janice Burberry, the head of public health at Leeds city council, said the early years were a good time to intervene to support families. &lsquo;Parents want to do the best for their children,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;We wanted to focus on prevention because it&rsquo;s very, very difficult when obesity has taken hold to tackle it. We understand that there is no magic bullet here. Parents are experts in their own lives, and they know what they can and can&rsquo;t achieve. The strategy of &lsquo;Henry&rsquo; is about sitting alongside parents and thinking through what&rsquo;s right for them.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The public health minister, Seema Kennedy, was enthusiastic. &lsquo;There are some fantastic pockets of work happening in early years already, and while still in the early phases, it is encouraging to see what can be achieved locally through interventions like this,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I know how hard it can be for busy parents to make healthy choices for their families, so anything that can make it easier is a real lifeline.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 28-31<br></span><span class="c0">Choose the correct letter, A, B, C or D.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">28.

Their fans in the film were actual fans of the group and transferred their enthusiasm to the actors very convincingly. I assumed there would be plenty of music, linked by weak dialogue, but I was wrong. And the support that band members gave to lead singer Jerry Cosgrove when tragedy entered his life had me close to tears, giving me a new appreciation of the band.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">B Home Fires<br></span><span class="c0">I expected a standard, rather dull, story about domestic life, like the director&rsquo;s last two films. Instead, Home Fires had me on the edge of my seat with excitement. It&rsquo;s certainly worth a second viewing. Having said that, although it is apparently a film intended for all ages, many children would find the long discussions of relationship issues boring, and they contributed little or nothing to the film.</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"><br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">C The Jeffersons<br></span><span class="c0">One of the most popular films of the past half century is Mary and Tom, and a remake of it seems unnecessary. Nevertheless, The Jeffersons has some delightful elements, particularly the acting of Yvonne Richards. She really brought the character she played to life, but sadly, neither she nor the other actors could make the script sound natural.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">D Space Challenge 5<br></span><span class="c0">This film makes an important ethical point about treating other people with respect, but that is likely to be missed by many teenagers, the target audience, as it assumes familiarity with the world as it was 20 years ago.

It has nothing to do with the employees&rsquo; ability to do their jobs. However, dealing with redundancy can be difficult. Here are some tips on how to cope.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">First of all, don&rsquo;t panic. It&rsquo;s common for people to either rush into a flurry of activity or be frozen by the shock of being suddenly made redundant. The best course of action is to keep calm and draw up a list of all of the things you need to arrange in the months ahead. It&rsquo;s important to find out what your rights are. Obtain a copy of the in-house redundancy policy if there is one and check out your contract for exit terms.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Try to maintain good relations wherever possible with your employer, even if you are angry about the manner of your exit. You will still need a reasonable reference when the time comes to move on, and it may be that your boss can make useful introductions or offer you consultancy work.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Help from a professional outplacement company can make a huge difference to your job search success and reduce the amount of time taken to find your next role. You can purchase this yourself, but there are advantages to having it arranged via your company.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Don&rsquo;t rush into applying for any or every job that comes up. Take stock of what you have to offer, what you want to do, and carry out in-depth research to find out what employers are actually looking for. Talk to people in your target industry for career advice and information. This information will be invaluable in helping you identify potential employers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Assess whether there are any gaps in experience or qualifications that could be a barrier to getting another job and address them. Enrol on some of those courses you have always been too busy to go on: not only will this enhance your skills, it also shows your commitment to continuous professional development.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Redundancy enables you to move your career forward in line with your own personal agenda. Although it can be traumatic, many people find that redundancy is actually the incentive they need to take their career in the direction they actually want to go. So think about what you really want, and go for it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 15-21<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the notes below.

This challenges the widespread assumptions that men were the sole producers of books throughout the period in European history known as the Middle Ages {600-1500 AD). They did so by identifying particles of blue pigment in the fossilised dental plaque of a medieval woman as lapis lazuli, an extremely valuable stone at the time. The findings are the first of their kind and strongly suggest it will be possible to increase the profile of ancient female artists in the historical and archaeological record by analysing their dirty teeth.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">B</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This discovery was made possible by applying technological advances in the field of archaeological science to a little-studied deposit on teeth known as tartar, which is mineralised dental plaque. In most societies today, oral hygiene practices are part of our daily routine, meaning that dental plaque is regularly removed and doesn&rsquo;t have a chance to build up on our teeth. This was not the case in the past. Plaque built up and mineralised over the course of people&rsquo;s lives. This solid deposit has unique archaeological potential. A key characteristic of dental plaque is that while it forms it has the ability to entrap a wide range of microscopic and molecular debris that enters a person&rsquo;s mouth. When dental plaque hardens and becomes tartar, it can entomb these particles and molecules for hundreds or thousands of years &ndash; potentially even millions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">C</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The majority of scholarly work conducted on ancient tartar has been centred on what people ate but, besides taking in food, the human mouth is subject to a constant influx of particles of different types directly from the environment. Tree and grass pollen, spores, cotton fibres, medicinal plants and micro-charcoal have all been reported among the finds from this type of dental analysis. Despite such promising evidence, the value of tartar as environmental evidence has not, so far, been much exploited.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">D</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The team analysed the skeletal remains of a female individual, known as B78, who lived in the 11th&mdash;12th century. She was buried in the grounds of a former women&rsquo;s monastery in Dalheim, Germany, that is in ruins today but was occupied by various religious groups for around a thousand years. They found well over 100 bright blue particles, in the form of small crystals and individual flecks, scattered throughout the tartar which was still preserved on her teeth. Her skeletal remains had not indicated anything particular about her life, besides a general indication that she probably did not do any hard labour. The blue particles were unlike any other discovery &ndash; firstly because of their colour, and secondly because of their sheer number.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">E</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;To be sure about the nature of the particles of bright blue powder trapped in the woman&rsquo;s tartar, a range of microscopy techniques were used. All techniques provided the same results: the blue specks were lazurite, the blue portion of the lapis lazuli stone, a substance more precious than gold in Medieval Europe. Afghanistan was the only source of the stone at the time, and the preparation of the pigment took great skill.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">F</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;So how did particles of this precious material end up deposited on this woman&rsquo;s teeth? A variety of reasons were possible, from painting to accidental ingestion during pigment preparation, or even the consumption of the powder as a medicine. But the way in which the blue particles were found in her tartar &ndash; single flecks in different areas &ndash; pointed to repeated exposure, not a single intake. And creating a vivid blue pigment from lapis lazuli required an Arabic method of oil flotation that did not appear in European artists&rsquo; manuals until after the 15th century. This all suggests that it&rsquo;s more likely that this ultramarine pigment was brought into the region as a finished product for use by artists.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">G</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The most likely explanation, then, is that this was an artist who repeatedly used her lips to make a fine point on the end of her brush in order to paint intricate detail on manuscripts. This finding suggests that women were more involved in the production of books throughout the Middle Ages than tends to be thought. Before the 12th century fewer than one per cent of the books that still remain can be traced to the work of women. Additionally, artists are largely invisible in both the historic and archaeological records as they rarely signed their work before the 15th century and, until now, there have been no known skeletal markers directly associated with producing art. The work strongly points to the possibility of using microscopic particles entombed in ancient tartar to track the artists of ancient times. It also suggests that it may be possible to track other &lsquo;dusty&rsquo; crafts using this method and thereby reveal the invisible workforce behind many forms of art.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 28-32<br></span><span class="c0">Choose the correct letter, A, B, C or D.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">28.

This information is provided to introduce our Institute and to let you know some of the important features of our professional training courses.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Courses<br></span><span class="c0">Percil Training Institute was established to provide high quality short-duration training programmes for a range of professional needs. It has a highly trained and experienced teaching staff, many of whom have taught overseas.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Percil Training Institute provides courses in ten-week modules. Most courses (e.g. Office Management, Librarianship, Medical Records Organisation) consist of two modules, although some courses (Biotechnology, Computer Analysis) are three or four modules long. There is a break of two weeks between each module but since projects or assignments are set for completion in these periods, it is not possible to take vacations during this time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since each course has varying needs, there are not necessarily any set hours for classes across all programmes. You will need to consult the timetable for your course, which is printed at the front of your own course manual.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Please be reminded that Percil Training Institute cannot provide attendance or achievement certificates for students who have missed part of their course as a result of not reading their own course timetables properly. Legitimate reasons for non-attendance (e.g. illness) will be given consideration provided that documentary evidence is provided. In this case, an achievement certificate only will be issued.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Facilities<br></span><span class="c0">The opening times of the snack bar, coffee lounge and restaurant are printed below your course timetable. No bookings are required for any of the eating places except the restaurant for Friday and Saturday dinner. The coffee lounge and restaurant are not normally open on public holidays. However, a group booking may be made for the restaurant for dinner on such days, provided that there is a minimum of 20 people in the group. A non-refundable deposit will be required for such a booking.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Institute has a very fine sports complex. The swimming pool is open daily from 8.00 am to 8.00 pm and can be used free of charge by all Percil students wbo present a valid student enrolment card. The squash courts can be booked by any student with a valid student card and the hire cost is $4.50 per half hour. The gymnasium is available for a ten-week membership fee of $40.00, or $5.00 per visit, or an annual subscription of $100. Guests of Percil students are welcome to use the swimming pool but not the gymnasium areas.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Security<br></span><span class="c0">Please be careful that you do not leave valuable items in the classroom areas at any time. Percil Training Institute cannot be held responsible for any loss or damage to students&rsquo; property as a result of student negligence. After 8.30 pm the front doors of the Institute are locked. If you need to gain access to the Institute after this time, please contact the caretaker by pressing the doorbell and speaking through the intercom. If you are admitted by the caretaker you will be required to show your student card.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Medical Care<br></span><span class="c0">Minor accidents and injuries can usually be attended to on the premises, in the Health Centre on the third floor. These services are free. Headache pills and other analgesics are available at standard pharmacy prices.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 15-24<br></span><span class="c0">Do the following statements agree with the information given in the text?

These scholarships are available for full-time study only and are not offered for courses of less than 20 weeks&rsquo; duration.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Requirements/eligibility<br></span><span class="c0">Applicants for these scholarships must be of high academic ability as revealed in the qualifications they have already gained in their home country; alternatively, they must have at least five years of significant work experience in their chosen field and must produce evidence in the form of references from at least two employers or supervisors.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The award<br></span><span class="c0">These scholarships offer return airfares to Australia from your home country, provided that the distance by air from your city of departure to Sydney is not more than 2,500 kilometres. If the distance exceeds this amount, you will be provided with airline vouchers. Travel expenses to and from airports on both the outward and return journeys are paid for, and there is an airline excess baggage allowance of 120 kg.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Personal removal expenses for scholarship holders are not paid. If the scholarship holder is married at the time of applying for the scholarship, some travel and removal costs may be paid for the husband or wife. Travel costs or support for dependent children are at the scholarship holders expense.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Scholars are eligible for assistance with accommodation within the Sydney metropolitan area, although married accommodation is unavailable on the Percil Institute campus. Since demand for accommodation on the campus is always high, scholarship applicants are advised to apply at least ten weeks before intending to come into residence.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 25-27<br></span><span class="c3">Answer the questions below.

It is an intensive 3,500-acre farm that has been &lsquo;rewilded&rsquo;, that is, allowed to return to its natural, uncultivated state. After barely a decade, nature has come back astonishingly quickly. Neat fields of maize have been replaced with a landscape that resembles the typical grasslands of Africa. The original narrow clipped hedges that edged the farmland are now eight metres wide, and deer race through ragwort, thistles and other weeds in the meadows. The estate boasts more of the unusual purple emperor butterflies than anywhere else in Britain. It&rsquo;s also thought to be the only place where Britain&rsquo;s fastest-declining birds, turtle doves, are multiplying. But as rewilding blossoms, so do controversies.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In Wales, one ecologist says the concept can&rsquo;t even be mentioned to farmers. Even the harmless beaver is the subject of fierce debate: while it was recognised as a native animal in Scotland last year, beavers reintroduced in south-west England roam free only on a government trial. &lsquo;For us it is strange to see the British struggling with the beaver. Come on, we have thousands of them!&rsquo; Dutch ecologist Leo Linnartz told a rewilding conference. Linnartz says that many Dutch objected to &lsquo;nature development&rsquo; 30 years ago but rewilding principles are now mainstream.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In Britain, the rewilding movement started by writer and environmental activist George Monbiot is popularly seen to seek the return of large carnivores &ndash; bears, wolves and lynx. In practice, it is returning more modest herbivores like ponies and deer to the countryside. For decades, ecologists believed the end result of allowing a landscape to run wild would be dense forest and a mass extinction of sun-loving wild flowers and butterflies. But this belief has been demolished by Dutch ecologist Frans Vera. Since the 1980s, Vera has introduced wild cattle, horses and deer to rewilded marshland, and proved that &rsquo;natural&rsquo; grazing creates a more dynamic landscape, a constantly changing pattern of open glades and wooded groves.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the Scottish Highlands, rewilding is taking a different form as large landowners restore ancient pine forest. But David Balharry, former Scotland director of Rewilding Britain, cautions that rewilding in Scotland will only be championed by policymakers and politicians when it is led by local communities.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For Burrell, rewilding has been a pragmatic way to revive the struggling family farm. Ecotourism there makes as much profit as his conventional farm did. Knepp&rsquo;s unproductive soil meant Burrell could not compete with globalised food production. His profits may be steady while conventional dairy and cattle farm incomes fall dramatically, but no farmers have yet followed his example. &lsquo;It takes a new eye to look at this and say, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s beautiful&rdquo;, rather than go, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just a real mess&rdquo;,&rsquo; says Burrell. &lsquo;Other farmers may have a moral attitude towards it too &ndash; &ldquo;why are you stopping food production?&rdquo;&rsquo; Many criticise rewilding for abandoning productive farmland when the world&rsquo;s population is growing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wouter Helmer, director of Rewilding Europe, sees no conflict between food production and rewilding: Europe is heading for a future of food produced more intensively in fewer areas, releasing less productive land for rewilding, he says. &lsquo;Farming is being done by fewer and fewer farmers on a larger scale on the best soils. They leave the less profitable lands to become adventure land for an increasingly urban population.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Helmer says there is no point in seeking to feed the world with traditional organic farming because there is no one to do the labour: when he asks Dutch students who wants to farm, none raise their hands. They have a completely different relationship to nature to their parents or grandparents. They are not fighting with it on a daily basis. On one hand they are disconnected from nature but on the other hand they are becoming more relaxed with nature &ndash; it&rsquo;s hunting and gathering but hunting with a camera and gathering experiences. The part of the countryside which is not used for intensive farming starts to serve all these new urban needs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yet some environmentalists worry how rewilding connects with urban populations. The challenge is how to make rewilding an issue that people in their ordinary lives can take action on, says Elaine Gilligan of Friends of the Earth. She thinks it is great for engaging people in nature but doubts whether it is seen as important in large urban areas like Birmingham.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rewilders argue that reducing flood risks for cities is one practical way rewilding can enhance urban life. Ted Green, founder president of the Ancient Tree Forum, believes that intensive farming can worsen flash flooding, and cause fertile earth to be swept downriver and out to sea. The land may belong to the landowner but the soil must belong to the nation,&rsquo; says Green. &lsquo;When you see people cleaning out their houses after floods, you don&rsquo;t see them removing water, you see them removing mud. It&rsquo;s no longer an engineering problem &ndash; it&rsquo;s a farming problem.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Some conservationists worry, however, that rewilding could replace the traditional protection of rare species on small nature reserves. &lsquo;If rewilding really takes off, there&rsquo;s a risk people will say, &ldquo;Oh we don&rsquo;t have to do any of that old stuff,&rdquo;&rsquo; says Matt Shardlow, chief executive of Buglife. &lsquo;But we still have habitat fragmentation and species in tiny places and we have to take care of them even if you have some areas made bigger for wildlife.&rsquo; Whatever happens, we need more projects like Knepp.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Questions 28-30<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the summary below.

Some people are against rewilding as it reduces the amount of crops that could provide much needed nourishment.<br>32. It may not be easy to get city residents to take part in rewilding.<br>33. Rewilding does not necessarily lead to a landscape thickly covered in trees.<br>34. It is acceptable to turn fields which do not yield many crops into natural spaces for people to enjoy.<br>35. The support of people living in the area is needed to make the authorities take rewilding seriously.<br>36.
