it&rsquo;s important to learn foreign languages &ndash; and I&rsquo;m very pleased when I can watch a video in class and understand it. Mr Peckham really pushes us, and offers us extra assignments, to help us improve. That&rsquo;s good for me, because otherwise I&rsquo;d be quite lazy.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">B Lucy<br></span><span class="c4 c3">History is my favourite subject, and it&rsquo;s fascinating to see how what we learn about the past is relevant to what&rsquo;s going on in the world now. It&rsquo;s made me understand much more about politics, for instance. My plan is to study history at university, and maybe go into the diplomatic service, so I can apply a knowledge of history.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">C Mark<br></span><span class="c4 c3">Thursdays are my favourite days, because that&rsquo;s when we have computing. It&rsquo;s the high spot of the week for me &ndash; I love learning how to program. I began when I was about eight, so when I started doing it at school, I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have any problem with it, but I was quite wrong! When I leave school, I&rsquo;m going into my family retail business, so sadly I can&rsquo;t see myself becoming a programmer.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">D Violeta<br></span><span class="c4 c3">My parents both work in leisure and tourism, and they&rsquo;ve always talked about their work a lot at home. I find it fascinating. I&rsquo;m studying it at school, and the teacher is very knowledgeable, though I think we spend too much time listening to her: I&rsquo;d like to meet more people working in the sector, and learn from their experience.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">E Walid<br></span><span class="c4 c3">I&rsquo;ve always been keen on art, so I chose it as an optional subject, though I was afraid the lessons might be a bit dull. I needn&rsquo;t have worried, though &ndash; our teacher gets us to do lots of fun things, so there&rsquo;s no risk of getting bored. At the end of the year the class puts on an exhibition for the school, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to showing some of my work to other people.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Questions 1-6<br></span><span class="c4 c3">Look at the five comments about lessons, A-E.

Ever since last year&rsquo;s festival, the committee has been hard at work to make this year&rsquo;s the best ever! The theme is Ripton through the ages. Scenes will be acted out showing how the town has developed since it was first established. But there&rsquo;s also plenty that&rsquo;s up-to-date, from the latest music to local crafts.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">The Craft Fair is a regular part of the festival. Come and meet professional artists, designers and craftsmen and women, who will display their jewellery, paintings, ceramics, and much more. They&rsquo;ll also take orders, so if you want one of them to make something especially for you, just ask! You&rsquo;ll get it within a month of the festival ending.<br>The Saturday barbecue will start at 2 pm and continue until 10 pm, with a bouncy castle for kids. The barbecue will be held in Palmer&rsquo;s Field, or in the town hall if there&rsquo;s rain. Book your tickets now, as they always sell out very quickly! Entry for under 16s is free all day; adults can come for free until 6 pm and pay &pound;5 after that. There&rsquo;ll be live music throughout, with local amateur bands in the afternoon and professional musicians in the evening.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">On Sunday we&rsquo;re delighted to introduce an afternoon of boat races, arranged by the Ripton Rowing Club. The spectator area by the bridge has plenty of room to stand and cheer the boats home, in addition to a number of benches. The winners of the races will be presented with trophies by the mayor of Ripton. All money raised by the festival will go to support the sports clubs in Ripton.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Questions 7-14<br></span><span class="c4 c3">Do the following statements agree with the information given in the text?

There are always jobs to be done and some tasks require physical manual work. While it is good for people to be active, there are risk factors associated with this, and efforts need to be made to reduce them.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">The first risk relates to the carrying of an excessive load or weight. This places undue demands on the spine and can cause permanent damage. Examples of tasks that involve this risk are moving 50-kilogramme fertiliser bags from one site to another or carrying heavy buckets of animal feed around fields. According to the UK Health and Safety Executive, activities such as these &lsquo;should be avoided at all times&rsquo;. Their documentation states that other methods should be considered, such as breaking down the load into smaller containers prior to movement or transporting the materials using a tractor or other vehicle. The risk posed by excessive force is made worse if the person lifting is also bending over as this increases pressure on the discs in the back.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c4">If a load is bulky or hard to grasp, such as a lively or agitated animal, it will be more difficult to hold while lifting and carrying. The holder may adopt an awkward posture, which is tiring and increases the risk of injury. Sometimes a load has to be held away from the body because there is a large obstacle in the area and the person lifting needs to be able to see where their feet are going. This results in increased stress on the back; holding a load at arm&rsquo;s length imposes about five times the stress of a close-to-the-body position. In such cases, handling aids should be purchased that can take the weight off the load and minimise the potential for injury.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Another risk that relates to awkward posture is repetitive bending when carrying out a task. An example might be repairing a gate that has collapsed onto the ground. This type of activity increases the stress on the lower back because the back muscles have to support the weight of the upper body. The farmer should think about whether the job can be performed on a workbench, reducing the need for prolonged awkward posture.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Questions 15-20<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the table below.

It stands to reason, therefore, that how you treat your customers has a direct impact on your profit margins. Some customers just want to browse and not be bothered by sales staff. Try to be sensitive to how much help a customer wants; be proactive in offering help without being annoying. Suggest a product that naturally accompanies what the customer is considering or point out products for which there are special offers, but don&rsquo;t pressure a customer into buying an item they don&rsquo;t want.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Build up a comprehensive knowledge of all the products in your shop, including the pros and cons of products that are alike but that have been produced under a range of brand names. If you have run out of a particular item, make sure you know when the next orders are coming in. Negativity can put customers off instantly. If a customer asks a question to which the answer is no&rsquo;, do not just leave it at that &ndash; follow it with a positive, for example; &lsquo;we&rsquo;re expecting more of that product in on Tuesday&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Meanwhile, if you see a product in the wrong place on a shelf, don&rsquo;t ignore it &mdash; put it back where it belongs. This attention to presentation keeps the shop tidy, giving the right impression to your customers. Likewise, if you notice a fault with a product, remove it and replace it with another.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">When necessary, be discreet. For example, if the customer&rsquo;s credit card is declined at the till, keep your voice down and enquire about an alternative payment method quietly so that the customer doesn&rsquo;t feel humiliated. If they experience uncomfortable emotions in your shop, it&rsquo;s unlikely that they&rsquo;ll come back.<br>Finally, good manners are probably the most important aspect of dealing with customers. Treat each person with respect at all times, even when you are faced with rudeness. Being discourteous yourself will only add more fuel to the fire.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Build a reputation for polite, helpful staff and you&rsquo;ll find that customers not only keep giving you their custom, but also tell their friends about you.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Questions 21-27<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the sentences below. Choose </span><span class="c1">NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;from the text for each answer.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">21.

The artwork, designed to raise public awareness, left Ferrando angry &ndash; and fuelled with entrepreneurial ideas.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">B</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;Ferrando runs a Spanish-based design company, Closca, that produces an ingenious foldable bicycle helmet. But he has now also designed a stylish glass water bottle with a stretchy silicone strap and magnetic closure mechanism that means it can be attached to almost anything, from a bike to a bag to a pushchair handle. The product comes with an app that tells people where they can fill their bottles with water for free.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">C</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;The intention is to persuade people to stop buying water in plastic bottles, thus saving consumers money and reducing the plastic waste piling up in our oceans. &lsquo;Bottled water is now a $100 billion business, and 81 per cent of the bottles are not recycled. It&rsquo;s a complete waste &ndash; water is only 1.5 per cent of the price of the bottle!&rsquo; Ferrando cries. Indeed, environmentalists estimate that by 2050 there will be more plastic in our oceans than fish and that&rsquo;s mainly down to such bottles. &lsquo;We are trying to create a sense that being environmentally sophisticated is a status symbol,&rsquo; he adds. &lsquo;We want people to clip their bottles onto what they are wearing, to show that they are recycling &ndash; and to look cool.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">D</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;Ferrando&rsquo;s story is fascinating because it seems like an indicator of something unexpected. Three decades ago, conspicuous consumption &ndash; the purchase of luxuries, such as handbags, shoes, cars, etc. on a lavish scale &ndash; heightened people&rsquo;s social status. Indeed, the closing decades of the 20th century were a time when it seemed that anything could be turned into a commodity. Hence the fact that water became a consumer item, sold in plastic bottles, instead of just emerging, for free, from a tap.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">E</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;Today, though, conspicuous extravagance no longer seems desirable among consumers. Now, recycling is fashionable &ndash; as is cycling rather than driving. Plastic water bottles have become so common that they do not command status; instead, what many millennials &ndash; young people born in the late 20th century &ndash; prefer to post on social media are &lsquo;real&rsquo; (refillable) bottles or even the once widespread Thermos bottles, Some teenagers currently think that these stainless-steel vacuum-insulated water bottles that are coming back onto the market are ultra &lsquo;cool&rsquo;; never mind the fact that they feel oddly out-of-date to anyone over the age of 40 or that teenagers in the 1970s would have avoided ever being seen with one.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">F</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;it is uncertain whether Closca will succeed in its goal. Although its foldable bike helmet is available in some outlets in New York, including the Museum of Modern Art, it can be very hard for any design entrepreneur to really take off in the global mass market, though not as hard as it might have been in the past. If an entrepreneur had wanted to fund a smart invention a few decades ago, he or she would have had to either raise a bank loan, borrow money from a family member or use a credit card. Things have moved on slightly since then.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">G</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;Entrepreneurs are still using the last two options, but some are also tapping into the ever-growing pot of money that is becoming available in the management world for &lsquo;corporate social responsibility&rsquo; (CSR) investments. And then there are other options for those who wish to raise money straight away. Ferrando posted details about his water-bottle venture on a large, recognised platform for funding creative projects. He appealed for people to donate $30,000 of seed money &ndash; the money he needed to get his project going &ndash; and promised to give a bottle to anyone who provided more than $39 in &lsquo;donations&rsquo;. If he received the funds, he stated that the company would produce bottles in grey and white; if $60,000 was raised, a multicoloured one would be made. Using this approach, none of the donors has a stake in his idea, nor does he have any debt. Instead, it is almost a pre-sale of the product, in a manner that tests demand in advance and creates a potential crowd of enthusiasts.

Before you look for a builder, it&rsquo;s important to develop a comprehensive budget and have clear plans. Once you have a design in mind, it is time to start narrowing down your builder shortlist, and this starts with assessing how qualified each builder is. In Australia, this means checking that the builder holds a residential building licence. Most states have their own building authority who you can contact to check a builder&rsquo;s licence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">You can also check if the builder is a member of an industry association such as the Housing Industry Association (HIA), and whether they have won any industry awards. For instance, the HIA runs a state and national awards programme, with a category that recognises the level of customer service that a builder delivers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Most experts agree that display homes {homes constructed by the builder that are open to the public) offer a great opportunity to study their work up close. Display homes are usually offered by major project builders who work on a large scale and can deliver good quality and value. You can also talk to the salesperson and find out about the home design and what is and isn&rsquo;t included in the sale price. And it may be possible to talk to other customers you meet there and ask their opinion of the workmanship in the display home.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3"><br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Finally, avoid signing any business contract before you have read and understood it thoroughly. Ask your builder to use a standard building contract that has been designed to comply with the Domestic Building Contracts Act, and to be fair to both client and builder. You have five business days within which you may withdraw from the contract after signing it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Questions 1-7<br></span><span class="c4 c3">Do the following statements agree with the information given in the text?

After selecting a builder, you should decide on the design of your new house.<br>2. In Australia, you can make sure that a builder has the appropriate licence.<br>3. The best builders usually belong to the Housing Industry Association.<br>4. The HIA gives an award to builders whose standards of customer service are very high.<br>5. Builders who work on smaller projects are more likely to have display homes.<br>6. It is advisable to have a contract which is in accordance with the Domestic Building Contracts Act.<br>7.

One possible reason is that many managers of small businesses have an inadequate knowledge of health and safety issues. Many managers of small businesses claim their situation is made worse by bureaucracy, arguing that the huge number of regulations &mdash; not just on health and safety but also on tax, the minimum wage, and much, much more &ndash; makes their work difficult.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Many managers are simply not aware of their responsibilities. They are too busy running their companies to read manuals, employ consultants or go to seminars. Moreover, the average business person doesn&rsquo;t know where and how to get information. The Federation of Small Businesses argues that the special nature of small businesses should be recognised by health and safety inspectors, with an emphasis on education and how to comply with the law, rather than simply on enforcement. For instance, inspectors could make employers aware of what they really need to know, rather than swamping them with mountains of leaflets which may not be relevant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Improvements are being made, however. The Health and Safety Executive has issued a free guide to the most important health and safety laws for employers. All employers must have their own health and safety policy statement and, for businesses with more than five employees, this must be in writing. It should be specific to the business and clear about the arrangements for and organisation of health and safety at work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">It should state a strategy, detail how it will be implemented and by whom, and say when it will be reviewed and updated. It is advisable to involve employees in this process, as they have direct experience. Assessing and identifying risks is the starting point. But to comply with the law, businesses must train their employees about health and safety, and provide information to others who need to know, such as the contractors working for them. These are often smaller companies that carry out most of the dangerous work. Helping them to get into good safety habits makes it easier for them to tender for work from big companies. Other advice from the Health and Safety Executive for small businesses tackles specific issues, such as helping small companies to deal with work-related stress.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Questions 21-27<br></span><span class="c4 c3">Complete the sentences below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">21.

The apprenticeship for this job lasted many years and was tough and challenging. It principally involved memorizing hieroglyphic symbols and practicing handwritten lettering. Scribes noted the everyday activities in ancient Egypt and wrote about everything from grain stocks to tax records. Therefore, most of our information on this rich culture comes from their records. Most scribes were men from privileged backgrounds. The occupation of scribe was among the most sought-after in ancient Egypt. Craftspeople endeavored to get their sons into the school for scribes, but they were rarely successful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">As in many civilizations, the lower classes provided the means for those above them to live comfortable lives. You needed to work if you wanted to eat, but there was no shortage of jobs at any time in Egypt&rsquo;s history. The commonplace items taken for granted today, such as a brush or bowl, had to be made by hand; laundry had to be washed by hand, clothing sewn, and sandals made from papyrus and palm leaves. In order to make these and have paper to write on, papyrus plants had to be harvested, processed, and distributed and all these jobs needed workers. There were rewards and sometimes difficulties. The reed cutter, for example, who harvested papyrus plants along the Nile, had to bear in mind that he worked in an area that was also home to wildlife that, at times, could prove fatal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">At the bottom rung of all these jobs were the people who served as the basis for the entire economy; the farmers. Farmers usually did not own the land they worked. They were given food, implements, and living quarters as payment for their labor. Although there were many more glamorous jobs than farming, farmers were the backbone of the Egyptian economy and sustained everyone else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The details of lower-class jobs are known from medical reports on the treatment of injuries, letters, and documents written on various professions, literary works, tomb inscriptions, and artistic representations. This evidence presents a comprehensive view of daily work in ancient Egypt &ndash; how the jobs were done, and sometimes how people felt about the work. In general, the Egyptians seem to have felt pride in their work no matter what their occupation. Everyone had something to contribute to the community, and no skills seem to have been considered non-essential. The potter who produced cups and bowls was as important to the community as the scribe, and the amulet-maker as vital as the pharmacist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Part of making a living, regardless of one&rsquo;s special skills, was taking part in the king&rsquo;s monumental building projects. Although it is commonly believed that the great monuments and temples of Egypt were achieved through slave labor, there is absolutely no evidence to support this. The pyramids and other monuments were built by Egyptian laborers who either donated their time as community service or were paid for their labor, and Egyptians from every occupation could be called on to do this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Stone had to first be quarried and this required workers to split the blocks from the rock cliffs. It was done by inserting wooden wedges in the rock which would swell and cause the stone to break from the face. The often huge blocks were then pushed onto sleds, devices better suited than wheeled vehicles to moving weighty objects over shifting sand. They were then rolled to a different location where they could be cut and shaped. This job was done by skilled stonemasons working with copper chisels and wooden mallets. As the chisels could get blunt, a specialist in sharpening would take the tool, sharpen it, and bring it back. This would have been constant daily work as the masons could wear down their tools on a single block.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The blocks were then moved into position by unskilled laborers. These people were mostly farmers who could do nothing with their land during the months when the Nile River overflowed its banks. Egyptologists Bob Brier and Hoyt Hobbs explain: &lsquo;For two months annually, workmen gathered by the tens of thousands from all over the country to transport the blocks a permanent crew had quarried during the rest of the year. Overseers organized the men into teams to transport the stones on the sleds.&rsquo; Once the pyramid was complete, the inner chambers needed to be decorated by scribes who painted elaborate images on the walls. Interior work on tombs and temples also required sculptors who could expertly cut away the stone around certain figures or scenes that had been painted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">While these artists were highly skilled, everyone &ndash; no matter what their job for the rest of the year &ndash; was expected to contribute to communal projects. This practice was in keeping with the value of ma&rsquo;at (harmony and balance) which was central to Egyptian culture. One was expected to care for others as much as oneself and contributing to the common good was an expression of this. There is no doubt there were many people who did not love their job every day, but the Egyptian government was aware of how hard the people worked and so staged a number of festivals throughout the year to show gratitude and give them days off to relax.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Questions 28-32<br></span><span class="c4 c3">Choose the correct letter, A, B, C or D.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">28.

Bear in mind, though, that mist often comes in from the sea and covers the hilltop.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">C</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;This route leads you through the village of Cottesloe, which was created in the 1930s and is famous for its strange-looking houses and ceramics factory, which is still the largest employer in the area. An artificial lake was originally created beside the village, and has since been filled in and turned into an adventure playground. After you leave Cottesloe, you have a choice of routes to return to the starting point, so either continue via Thurley Park, or if it&rsquo;s raining, take the shorter direct route.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3"><br><br></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">D</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;This walk is ideal in fine weather, as it takes you to the shore of a lake, at a spot convenient for swimming. Children will want to enjoy themselves in the adventure playground nearby. From there you continue to Starling Cottage, which draws people from around the world to visit the home, from 1920 to 1927, of the poet Barbara Cottam.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">E</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;If you want an easy, undemanding walk over flat ground, this walk will suit you perfectly. It passes the entrance to the famous Butter Caves visitor attraction, so you can combine a visit there with the walk, or just take shelter if it starts raining! On the final stage of the walk you pass through Wimpole, the village where Richard Merton, the architect of a number of local buildings, lived for much of his life.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Questions 1-5<br></span><span class="c4 c3">The text has five paragraphs, A-E.

A traditional scarecrow was a model &ndash; usually life-size &ndash; of a man or woman dressed in old clothes, and their purpose was to frighten the birds away; though how successful they were is a matter of opinion!</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Maplehampton&rsquo;s scarecrow competition took place on September 12th. Local farmers supplied everything needed to make a scarecrow &ndash; like pieces of wood to form a frame, and straw to stuff the scarecrow. The scarecrows were dressed in old clothes which the competitors brought with them.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">The festival was held in the village hall, instead of outdoors as planned, due to the unusually high temperature. There were two classes, one for adults and one for children, all of them working in small teams. Over 20 teams took part, each creating one scarecrow. They were encouraged by an audience of around 50, and had ideas and guidance from local artist Tracey Sanzo.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">The scarecrows were judged by a team of people from the village. The winning children&rsquo;s team made a scarecrow that looked like a giant bird &ndash; which would surely keep every real bird away! The winning adult team&rsquo;s scarecrow was dressed as an alien from another planet, and its face was painted to make it look very frightening &ndash; at least to human beings!</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">After the judging, many of the participants and the spectators had a picnic which they had brought. Some of the scarecrows then went home to their creators&rsquo; gardens. Alice Cameron, a local farmer, liked one of the scarecrows so much, she bought it to stand on her balcony: she said she didn&rsquo;t need it to scare birds away from her crops, as only bird-scarers that made a noise were effective. She just wanted to be able to see it! The event raised over &pound;300 for village funds.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Questions 6-14<br></span><span class="c4 c3">Do the following statements agree with the information given in the text?

As a barista, you must make a concerted effort to listen to your clientele and make sure the drinks you produce are correct in all respects. This is particularly important when you consider the sheer range and complexity of modern coffee drinks, which may start from a single (or double) shot of espresso but can include many additional elements. If you become distracted by the conversation that is going on nearby, you may ultimately miss the mark from a service perspective.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">One thing that separates a great from a good barista is that the former is constantly busy and has a strong work ethic. You will often catch a great barista rinsing out the filter in their machines, for example, as this erodes the build-up of burnt coffee oil that can begin to impact on the quality and taste of each espresso shot. Similarly, do not be surprised to hear the sound of the coffee grinder at work. This highlights the keen attention to detail that distinguishes skilled baristas, as they have the desire and the awareness to make every drink with completely fresh ground coffee. This type of attentiveness helps baristas to get the most from the coffee that they use, as many of the delicate aromas found in espresso are lost when exposed to the open air.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Timing is everything when it comes to producing the perfect cup of coffee. A great barista knows precisely when to finish the extraction of espresso, at the point when the balance of flavour has reached its optimum levels. They also understand how important this is; those who act too soon are left with a drink without flavour while those who delay the finish risk burning the beverage and tainting it with a bitter after-taste.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">When it comes to customer service, there is so much more to a coffee shop experience than drinking perfectly roasted blends. The atmosphere and the ambience also play a central role, and the interaction that the customer has with their barista sets the tone for an enjoyable experience. Great baristas ask their customers how their day is going or what they&rsquo;re going to do later; they read local newspapers and keep up with issues that really matter, all of which make a real difference in a competitive marketplace.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Questions 15-22<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the notes below.

A circle can work well for informal meetings, but sometimes the furniture cannot be re-arranged or rows are more suitable. Consider the participants and decide what is best. Before people arrive, it&rsquo;s a good idea to designate someone to stand at the entrance and greet everyone.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">If the meeting is small, start by requesting everyone to introduce themselves and to give a bit of relevant information in addition to their name. This may be what they do or why they are there. For all meetings, you need to introduce the chairperson, i.e., yourself, and any other outside speakers you have invited.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Next, make sure everyone can see the agenda or has a copy of it. Briefly run through the items then take one point at a time, and make sure the group doesn&rsquo;t stray from that point until it has been dealt with. Encourage participation at all times so that attendees can contribute but don&rsquo;t let everyone talk at the same time. Try to keep discussions positive, but don&rsquo;t ignore conflicts &ndash; find a solution for them and make sure they are resolved before they grow.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Summarise points regularly and make clear action points. Write these down and don&rsquo;t forget to note who&rsquo;s doing what, and by when. Encourage everyone to feel able to volunteer for tasks and roles. It can help if the more experienced members of the group offer to share skills and knowledge, but don&rsquo;t let the same people take on all the work as this can lead to tension within the group.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">At the end, remember to thank everyone for turning up and contributing. It can be nice to follow the meeting with a social activity like sharing a meal or going to a cafe.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Questions 23-27<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the flow chart below.

The Bersaglieri of the Italian Army, for example, still wear a bunch of long black feathers in their hats hanging down to one side, while British fusiliers have a clipped feather plume whose colour varies according to their regiment. The Royalists in the English Civil War adorned their headgear with ostrich feathers. &lsquo;Historically, feathers were an incredibly expressive accessory for men,1 observes Cambridge historian, Professor Ulinka Rublack. &lsquo;Nobody has really looked at why this was the case. That&rsquo;s a story that! want to tell.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Rublack is beginning to study the use of featherwork in early modern fashion as part of a joint project between the Universities of Cambridge, Basel and Bern. To the outsider, its preoccupations (her co-researchers are studying gold, glass and veils) might seem surprising. Yet such materials sustained significant economies and expertise.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">B</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;Rublack has spotted that something unusual started to happen with feathers during the 16th century. In 1500, they were barely worn at all in Europe; 100 years later they had become an indispensable accessory for the fashionable European man. In prosperous trading centres, the citizens started wearing hats bedecked with feathers from cranes and swallows. Headgear was specially manufactured so that feathers could be inserted more easily. By 1573, Plantin&rsquo;s Flemish-French dictionary was even obliged to offer words to describe people who chose not to wear them, recommending such terms as: &lsquo;the featherless&rsquo; and &lsquo;unfeathered&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Featherworking became big business. From Prague and Nuremberg to Paris and Madrid, people started to make a living from decorating feathers for clothing. Impressive efforts went into dyeing them. A 1548 recipe recommends using ashes, lead monoxide and river water to create a &lsquo;very beautiful&rsquo; black, for example.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">C</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;Why this happened will become clearer as Rublack&rsquo;s project develops. One crucial driver, however, was exploration &ndash; the discovery of new lands, especially in South America. Compared with many of the other species that early European colonists encountered, exotic birds could be captured, transported and kept with relative ease. Europe experienced a sudden &lsquo;bird-craze&rsquo;, as exotic birds became a relatively common sight in the continent&rsquo;s largest markets.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c3">Given the link with new territories and conquest, ruling elites wore feathers partly to express their power and reach. But there were also more complex reasons. In 1599, for example, Duke Frederick of Wurttemberg held a display at his court at which he personally appeared wearing a costume covered in exotic feathers and representing the Americas. This was not just a symbol of power, but of cultural connectedness, Rublack suggests: The message seems to be that he was embracing the global in a duchy that was quite insular and territorial.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">D</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;Nor were feathers worn by the powerful alone. In 1530, a legislative assembly at Augsburg imposed restrictions on peasants and traders adopting what it clearly felt should be an elite fashion. The measure did not last, perhaps because health manuals of the era recommended feathers could keep the wearer safe from &lsquo;bad&rsquo; air &ndash; cold, miasma, damp or excessive heat &ndash; all of which were regarded as hazardous. During the 1550s, Eleanor of Toledo had hats made from peacock feathers to keep her dry in the rain. Gradually, feathers came to indicate that the wearer was healthy and civilised. Artists and musicians took to wearing them as a mark of subtlety and style.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">E</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;As with most fads, this enthusiasm eventually wore off. By the mid-17th century, feathers were out of style, with one striking exception. Within the armies of Europe feathers remained an essential part of military costume. Rublack thinks that there may have been several reasons for this strange contradiction. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s associated with the notion of graceful warfaring,&rsquo; she says. This was a period when there were no standing armies and it was hard to draft soldiers. One solution was to aestheticise the military, to make it seem graceful and powerful.&rsquo; Feathers became associated with the idea of an art of warfare. They were also already a part of military garb among many native American peoples and in the Ottoman empire. Rublack believes that just as some of these cultures considered the feathers of certain birds to be highly significant, and sometimes sacred, European soldiers saw the feathers as imparting noble passions, bravery and courage.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">F</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;In time, her research may therefore reveal a tension about the ongoing use of feathers in this unlikely context. But, as she also notes, she is perhaps the first historian to have spotted the curious emotional resonance of feathers in military fashion at all. All this shows a sea-change in methodologies: historians now chart the ways in which our identities are shaped through deep connections with &lsquo;stuff&rsquo; &ndash; the material objects that are parts of our lives.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Questions 28-33<br></span><span class="c4 c3">The text on has six sections, A-F.

Although many people can write their own CVs, and do it well, others struggle with a variety of problems initially, such as not knowing how to structure a CV or how to highlight their most relevant strengths.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Through in-depth consultation, a professional CV writer can help identify exactly what is necessary for a particular role, cut out unnecessary or irrelevant details, and pinpoint what makes the individual stand out. This level of objectivity is one of the major benefits of working with a professional writer. It&rsquo;s often difficult to stand back from your own career history to assess what&rsquo;s relevant or not, or to choose the most appropriate qualities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">If you do choose to work with a professional CV writer, here are some tips:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Ask for a CV writer who has experience in your sector. HR professionals and recruiters with relevant experience can also have valuable insights into what companies are looking for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Look for someone who&rsquo;s prepared to take the time to find out your core qualities, who can choose exactly the right words for maximum impact and who understands what and where to edit. Ask to see samples of their work or use personal recommendations before you choose a CV writing service.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">You&rsquo;ll probably need to answer an in-depth email questionnaire or be interviewed before any writing actually starts. The more you can give your CV writer to work with, the better, so the promise of a quick turnaround time isn&rsquo;t always going to result in the best possible CV. Take the time to think about and jot down your career aims, your past successes, and the value you bring, before you start the whole process. Your CV will probably be used as a springboard for questions at interview, so you need to make sure you feel happy with the way it&rsquo;s being written and with the choice of words. Being involved in the writing process means your CV sounds authentic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Questions 15-20<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the sentences below.

Here are our top tips that will help you sail through your first day with ease. A new job is a great opportunity to hit the reset button. If you got into the habit of skipping breakfast at your last job, fit it in now or experiment with getting a workout in before going to the office. Having a routine you like and sticking to it definitely impacts on your overall happiness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">You&rsquo;ve probably already been into the office for an interview, so you&rsquo;ll have some idea of what the dress code is. While you definitely want to feel comfortable, it&rsquo;s best to play it safe, leaning towards a smarter and more polished look on your first day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">You don&rsquo;t want to be late, but getting to the office way too early can also potentially upset not only your schedule but other people&rsquo;s too. A good rule of thumb is to try and arrive 15 minutes ahead of the agreed start time. Accepting an invite to lunch with your boss and co-workers will allow you to get to know the people you&rsquo;ll be working with on a more personal level. It will also help you get a handle on personalities and work styles. To ensure the lunch goes well, have a few conversation starters in mind. That way, if the talk dries up, you can get it going again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">One of the big outcomes of going through a job search is you learn loads about yourself. In particular, you learn what you want and don&rsquo;t want, and what skills you bring to the table. With this new-found understanding, take some time over the initial period to think about what goals you have for your new role. In identifying these early on, you&rsquo;ll be one step closer to positioning yourself for success.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">It&rsquo;s important that you approach your new job with an open mind, and that you&rsquo;re ready to soak it all in. Be patient with yourself as you figure out how you fit in, and make sure you understand the way things are done before rushing into giving suggestions on improvements. Remember they hired you for a reason, so smile, relax a little and enjoy the first day of your next big thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Questions 21-27<br></span><span class="c3">Complete the notes below.

In one town in 18th- century Scotland, single women played an annual match against their married counterparts, though the motives behind the contest were not purely sporting. Some accounts say that the games were watched by a crowd of single men, who hoped to pick out a potential bride based on her footballing ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">By the late 19th century, with the men&rsquo;s game spreading across Britain like wildfire, women also began to take up association football. Early pioneers included Nettie J Honeyball, who founded the British Ladies&rsquo; Football Club (BLFC) in 1895. Honeyball was an alias: like many of the middle- and upper-class women who played in the late 19th century, she was not keen to publicise her involvement with a contact sport played on muddy fields. We know more about Lady Florence Dixie, who was appointed president of the BLFC in 1895 and who was an ardent believer in equality between the sexes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The BLFC arranged games between teams representing the north and the south of England, where money would be raised for those in need. These initially attracted healthy numbers of supporters although early newspaper reports were not particularly generous, with one reporter suggesting &lsquo;when the novelty has worn off, I do not chink women&rsquo;s football will attract the crowds&rsquo;. And crowds did drop off as the growing popularity of the men&rsquo;s game came to dominate public interest. In a country where women were not yet allowed to vote, it would take extraordinary circumstances for their efforts on the football pitch to attract widespread attention.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Those circumstances arose in 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War. With many men leaving their jobs to join the army, women started to work in factories and just as men had done before them, they began to play informal games of football during their lunch breaks. After some initial uncertainty, their superiors came to see these games as a means to boost morale and thus increase productivity. Teams soon formed and friendly matches were arranged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">In the town of Preston in the north of England, the female workers at a manufacturing company called Dick, Kerr &amp; Co showed a particular aptitude for the game. Watching from a window above the yard where they played, office worker Alfred Frankland spotted their talent and he set about forming a team. Under Frankland&rsquo;s management, they soon drew significant crowds to see their games. Known as Dick, Kerr&rsquo;s Ladies, they beat rival factory Arundel Coulthard 4-0 on Christmas Day 1917, with 10,000 watching at Preston stadium.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">After the war ended in 1918 the Dick, Kerr&rsquo;s side and other women&rsquo;s teams continued to draw large crowds. In 1920 there were around 150 women&rsquo;s sides in England and Dick, Kerr&rsquo;s Ladies packed 53,000 into Everton&rsquo;s Goodison Park stadium. The same year, the team found their one true genius: Lily Parr. Parr grew up playing football with her brothers, and began her career with her town&rsquo;s ladies&rsquo; team at the age of 14. When they played against the Dick, Kerr&rsquo;s side, she caught Frankland&rsquo;s eye and was offered a job at the factory &ndash; as well as a spot on the team. Close to six-feet tall and with jet-black hair, she had a ferocious appetite and a fierce left foot. She is credited with 43 goals during her first season playing for Dick, Kerr&rsquo;s Ladies and around 1,000 in total.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">By 1921 Dick, Kerr&rsquo;s Ladies were regularly attracting crowds in the tens of thousands. But the year ended in catastrophe for the women&rsquo;s game. The Football Association (FA) &ndash; officially the governing body for the sport as a whole, but really only concerned with men&rsquo;s competitions &mdash; had always taken a poor view of female participation. Women&rsquo;s football was tolerated during the war, but in the years that followed, driven by the fear that the women&rsquo;s game could affect Football League attendances, the FA sought to assert itself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Its solution was decisive and brutal. On 5 December 1921, the FA banned its members from allowing women&rsquo;s football to be played at its grounds, saying that football was &lsquo;quite unsuitable for females&rsquo;. The FA also forbade its members from acting as referees at women&rsquo;s games. To all intents and purposes, women&rsquo;s football in England was outlawed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">The FA also suggested that an excessive proportion of the gate receipts were absorbed in expenses and an inadequate percentage devoted to charity. No such obligation to donate profits existed for men&rsquo;s clubs and no proof of financial mismanagement was presented, but there was little the women&rsquo;s clubs could do in response. There was outrage from players, with the captain of Plymouth Ladies remarking that the FA was &lsquo;a hundred years behind the times&rsquo; and calling its decision &lsquo;purely sex prejudice&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">It was not until 1966 that serious efforts to revive the women&rsquo;s game began, but progress remained painfully slow. It took pressure from the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), to finally force the FA to end restrictions on women&rsquo;s football in 1971. By this time, half a century of progress had been lost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Questions 28-31<br></span><span class="c4 c3">Choose the correct letter, A, B, C or D.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">28.
