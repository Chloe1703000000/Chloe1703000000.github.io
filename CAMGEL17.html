This eye catching landmark has a distinctive Chinese styled green roof and red pillars.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">In 1958 a former lace padler C K Tang, foresaw that the area could become a bustling shopping centre since residents in the neighbouring Tanglin district had to pass enroute to work at the commercial centre Raffles Place. So with roof tiles brought in from his hometown in the Swatow province of China, Tang built a department store on what was then a cheap isolated plot of land. The plot faced a cemetery which is consolidated a bad omen in Chinese culture. His foresight paid off. Today Tangs is one of Singapore&rsquo;s most prominent and recognised home grown department stores proudly showcasing local fashion and household products. Even when the original building was torn down in 1982 to give way to the present superstore and skyscraper hotel it retained its unique Chinese architecture.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">From the foyer at Tangs turn left to Lucky Plaza. One of the oldest along Orchard Road, this mall is a perennial favourite with shoppers. Be amazed by the staggering array of cosmetics, jewellery, leather goods and hi-fi equipment. Prices though are not always fixed so bring along a good set of bargaining skills.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Coming out of Lucky Plaza continue along Orchard Road and enter the Paragon Shopping Centre. Apart from a wide range of shops and restaurants there is also a Singapore Airlines Service centre to facilitate bookings and offer information to tourists. Also available are a number of computer terminals for self booking. Check out the life-sized sculptures by a well known Taiwanese sculptor Sun Yu-li outside the shopping centre. These were inspired by depictions of life in rock paintings dating back 20000 years ago in Inner Mongolia.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Questions 11-14<br></span><span class="c0">Complete the sentences below.

No-one has the same behavioural make-up that you have. Likewise, everyone&rsquo;s career history is also unique. Why is it then that a great many CVs are mostly descriptions of past jobs or standard CV templates and give away very little about the individual behind the CV? It&rsquo;s almost as if the majority of job seekers are afraid to let their own personality shine through.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Perhaps in a corporate world where everyone feels they have to have the same professional image &mdash; dress in dark, formal suits, for example &mdash; the same is subconsciously felt to be true for CV writing. But there&rsquo;s a difficulty here: you want your CV to stand out and yet at the same time are afraid of saying anything that might make you stand out? The problem with the above thinking is painfully clear. Your CV will be dull, and likely to be swiftly passed over by an employer. Surely it is much better to be brave? To define your personal brand, as marketers might say. This isn&rsquo;t about making unsupportable statements: it&rsquo;s about choosing words that describe the qualities that drive your success. In short, what makes you good at your job.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Writing about oneself can sometimes be difficult. It involves the ability to see yourself from different people&rsquo;s viewpoints. Working with a professional CV writer is one way to achieve that and to present your character positively within a CV. Asking a colleague that you trust is also a good way to find out<br>how others see your strengths.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Try not to use classic recruitment clich&eacute;s. Everyone says they have great. &lsquo;communication&rsquo; or &lsquo;organisational&rsquo; skills. This gets ignored by recruiters. So, instead think carefully about who you are and what you bring and then. try to describe yourself. In that way you give recruiters something original to engage With, something that grabs their attention.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Questions 15-20<br></span><span class="c0">Complete the sentences below.

We&rsquo;re in tune With our targets and know how to reach them. Here are my top tips to bring order to your business life:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Organise your workspace<br></span><span class="c1 c0">Don&rsquo;t underestimate time lost or stress caused from an inefficient working<br>environment. To restore order:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Cut down documents and stationery to the bare essentials. Be ruthless and remove anything that doesn&rsquo;t directly serve a function in your day-to-day activity. One or two carefully selected photos to make your desk feel like home are fine, but avoid too many.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Create locations where you will keep all your work materials to make retrieval easy. Do this logically based on where you tend to use the items; for example, store spare copy paper near the printer. Move outside your immediate reach anything you use infrequently. Always return items once you have used them so they&rsquo;ll be where you expect them next time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Frustration ensues when you&rsquo;re searching for a client proposal, but it&rsquo;s buried among random papers. Eliminate desktop chaos by using trays, magazine files, or whatever you fancy and add clear labels such as &lsquo;In&rsquo;, &lsquo;Out&rsquo;, &lsquo;For Action&rsquo;, &lsquo;Current Projects&rsquo; or other relevant categories.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Be brutally honest about What you must keep. Studies suggest that 80% of what we file is never accessed again. Ask: do | know of a tax or legal requirement for retaining it? Why would this be important to me in future? Avoid &lsquo;miscellaneous&rsquo; as a category &mdash; you Won&rsquo;t remember What&rsquo;s in there.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Effective planning<br></span><span class="c1 c0">Plan your work; work your plan. Time spent planning saves untold hours in execution. Implementing regular planning strategies will sharpen your focus, thereby keeping you on track with your work. Start planning today for tomorrow. Near the close of each work day, implement a 10- to 15-minute routine to wrap up loose ends and prioritise key tasks. A good plan for tomorrow allows you to clear your head and enjoy your evening. Once a week, ring-fence a 60-to 90-minute appointment with yourself for larger scale planning. Use the time to do research or any of the thinking that normally takes aback seat.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Questions 21-27<br></span><span class="c0">Complete the notes below.

It is possible that the Romans undertook some mining, but coal mines across Europe largely date from the 13th century. Thereafter coal production increased steadily and it gradually replaced charcoal and wood as a source of heat and energy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Initially, coal mines were fairly shallow, but they quickly reached the point where artificial lighting was necessary. At first the lights used would have been no different from those used domestically &ndash; candles and simple oil lamps. But as coal mines became deeper, miners encountered a new and terrible problem &mdash; firedamp. This was a natural gas, principally consisting of methane, that exploded on contact with a naked flame. The first known major firedamp explosion, which killed 99 people, took place in Belgium in 1514 and as new technology was used to mine at increasingly deep levels, the problem got worse.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">B</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;The simplest solution was to improve the ventilation of the mine. Many mines had only one shaft leading from the surface down to the working area below. Ventilation could be improved to some extent by dividing this into a downcast (bringing in fresh air) and an upcast (returning foul air and firedamp to the surface).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">But what was really needed was a safe lamp that could not ignite firedamp. The earliest forms of safety lighting sought to produce light without using a naked flame. One early method tried to utilise the fact that skins removed from decaying fish contain the element phosphorus, which emits light in the form of phosphorescence. Unfortunately, this phosphorus is highly toxic, flammable and can self-ignite-hardly desirable properties in a safety light.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">An alternative was a device invented in about 1750, consisting of a flint which struck against a piece of iron when a handle was turned, creating a shower of sparks which lit up the surrounding area. These were believed to be too cool to ignite firedamp. This device had major drawbacks &mdash; extra manpower had to be used to operate it continuously, and it also required regular maintenance and replacement. But worst of all, it was not in fact safe, and numerous accidents were caused when the sparks ignited firedamp. Nonetheless, it was considered to be the least dangerous form of lighting at the time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">C</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;By about 1810 the problem was becoming acute, and in some cases there was no alternative to working in the dark. Some mines were being forced to stop production, with serious economic consequences for the mine owners and local communities. The general response, however, was to keep going and reluctantly accept the inevitable deaths from ignition of firedamp as a regrettable, but not especially remarkable, consequence of coal mining.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">The miners themselves could do little w they were largely illiterate, and depended on the mine owners for a livelihood However, the clerical, medical and legal professions were beginning to take notice. After 92 men and boys were killed in 1812 by an explosion at Felling Colliery in northern England, several professional people took action and a society was set up to raise funds for the discovery of new methods of lighting and ventilating mines. The first report of the society stated, &lsquo;It is to scientific men only that we must look up for assistance in providing a cheap and effectual remedy.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">D</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;As the leading chemist of the day, and an expert on gases, Sir Humphrey Davy was a natural choice from whom to seek help, and he was approached by the society in 1815. The general belief nowadays is that he was the inventor of the first miners&rsquo; safety lamp, in which the flame was enclosed by a mesh screen containing very small holes. Air could enter the lamp through the holes, but they were too small to allow the flame of the lamp to pass through them and ignite any firedamp present in the mine tunnels. Davy presented a paper describing the lamp in November 1815, and it was trialled in January 1816.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">However, a few weeks prior to Davy&rsquo;s presentation, an engineer called George Stephenson had independently designed and demonstrated a lamp based on the same scientific principles. After much discussion and argument, he was eventually recognised as deserving equal credit for the discovery, but the time needed for this recognition to be given meant that the miners&rsquo; safety lamp had already been called the &lsquo;Davy lamp&rsquo; and it is called that today.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">E</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;But in fact, the real inventor of the safety lamp was a man called Dr William Reid Clanny, who in 1813 had been awarded a silver medal by the Royal Society of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce for his own version of a safety lamp. Clancy&rsquo;s first lamp did not fulfil the needs of the ordinary working miner as it was rather heavy and cumbersome.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">But rather than seeking to glory in his achievement, he recognised its deficiencies and continued to work to improve it, as well as sharing his knowledge with others. George Stephenson acknowledged a debt to Clanny&rsquo;s research, and Humphrey Davy visited him in 1815 shortly before completing the design for his own safety lamp but to this day Dr Clanny remains a forgotten hero.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Questions 28-32<br></span><span class="c1 c0">The text has five sections A-E.

It&rsquo;s no defence to say that it was past sunset but not yet dark. The legal lighting obligations for cyclists are determined by sunset and sunrise times &ndash; not the hours of darkness which starts 30 minutes after the former end 30 minutes before the latter and dictate when motorists must switch from sidelights to headlights.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Cycling UK&rsquo;s guide to cycling regulations explains the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations in detail but in summary you need a white light at the front and a red light at the rear visible from the front and rear respectively and fixed to your bike. A light obscured by a saddlebag isn&rsquo;t legal and neither is a torch on your head though there&rsquo;s nothing to stop you using a head-torch as an additional light.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">The regulations also now allow flashing lights provided they flash between 60 and 240 times per minute. The legal requirements for reflectors include a red rear reflector and four amber pedal reflectors one at the front and rear of each pedal. Common sense might suggest that a reflective heel stripe or ankle band could replace an amber pedal reflector but unfortunately thee do not meet the legal requirements. This is an annoying problem for riders who use bikes where the feel are attached to the pedals and cannot slip. These pedals are not designed with enough space to accommodate reflectors and make this an area of legislation in need to change.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Unlike with other vehicles lights are not a legal requirement for cyclists when there is seriously reduced visibility during the daytime although we would not recommend cycling through dense fog without lighting up.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Questions 6-14<br></span><span class="c1 c0">Do the following statements agree with the information given in the passage above.

It should be stable and positioned so that it&rsquo;s comfortable when an employee uses a document holder but also big enough to let the user work comfortably and to alter their position.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">The working environment<br></span><span class="c1 c0">You need to assess noise levels. The equipment should not be so noisy that it distracts the user. If you cannot use quieter equipment consider soundproofing or moving the equipment. You could use partitions between noisy equipment and the rest of the workstation as an alternative.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Lighting is also an important consideration. Surrounding windows must have curtains or blinds which users can adjust to prevent reflected glare. If needed provide users with lighting appropriate to their tasks and particular workstation. Users should have control over their lighting to prevent reflected glare.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Temperature wise the equipment should not give out so much heat that the user becomes uncomfortable so monitor this. It&rsquo;s also important that you maintain ventilation and you control humidity so that it is at a level which keeps the user comfortable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Task design and rest breaks<br></span><span class="c1 c0">Good design of the task can be as important as the right choice of furniture and equipment. Whenever possible you should design jobs so that employees have a mix of activities and some control over which tasks they perform and when. You should match staffing levels to workload so that individuals are neither overworked nor underworked and give employees some say in the way is carried out and the planning that goes into it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">An employee&rsquo;s need for rest breaks will vary depending on the type of work they are doing and how intensely they are working. As a general rule however short, frequent breaks are better than longer, less frequent ones. A 5-10 minutes break after 50-60 minutes work is better than 15-20 minute break after two hours. The employee should at times have a choice over when to take breaks and they should be encouraged to do non-work activities during their break ideally away from the workstation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Questions 15-20<br></span><span class="c0">Complete the notes below.

Detailed visual inspections should be carried out on a regular basis, and they should have an up to date record of these. Before starting a job employers are also responsible for ensuring any ladder is the right length to meet the needs of the task reaching out from the very top of a ladder is highly dangerous. Once you get a ladder you as a user of the ladder should conduct a pre use check each working day. Conducting pre use checks should have been part of your training and should be done in accordance with the manufacturer&rsquo;s guidelines. When doing a check it is important to focus on the steps and make sure they are not loose as this could cause an accident. Similarly a cracked joint in the ladder could cause it to fail.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Almost all falls from ladders happen because the ladder moves unexpectedly. The key factor in preventing falls from ladders is to ensure your ladder is stable whilst being used. First make sure that you choose level ground on which to set up you ladder. There are specially designed tools you can use to ensure this &ndash; don&rsquo;t just use a piece of wood. Second check the ground surface is dirt free and solid so the feet can grip and the ladder doesn&rsquo;t sink.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Before you go up your ladder look at the surrounding environment. Make sure the ladder cannot be struck by vehicles. If necessary safeguard the area by placing red and white cones around it. Ensure it will not be pushed over by other hazards such as opening doors. Doors and windows may need to be secured where possible. Finally think about the hazards to the general pubic and make sure they cannot walk underneath it or get too near to it. A danger sign at the base is often the best way of doing this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">To secure the ladder tie it to a suitable point such as a window or railing making sure both sides are attached. Where this is not practical secure it to the wall near the base of the ladder with ties; avoid using blocks to wedge the ladder in place as they can easily move.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Questions 21-27<br></span><span class="c0">Complete the sentences below.

Forbury accomplished this fabulous feat by sailing over crossbar head first and backward. As colorfully described that day by the Los Angeles Times, &ldquo;Fosbury goes over the bar like a guy being pushed out of a 30 storey window.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">B</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;At first when asked about how this unorthodox manoeuvre originated, Fosbury would joke with sportswriters, informing some that because of this university background in physics and engineering he had initially designed the Flop on paper and telling others that he had accidentally discovered this technique when he once tripped and fell backward on his take off. However in later interviews Fosbury revealed that the technique actually unfolded over many years and involved countless trials and errors. &ldquo;It was simply a natural technique that evolved.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I never thought about how to change it and I am sure my coach was going crazy because it kept evolving. I didn&rsquo;t know anyone else in the world would be able to use it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">C</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Fosbury explained that when he first learned to high jump at the age of 10 or 11, he tried jumping with the scissors style. He said, &ldquo; I used that style until I went into high school where my coach explained that I was never going to get anywhere with that technique. He started me with the belly roll technique. However I was really lousy with that style. I expressed my frustration to coach and he said that if I really wanted I could still use the scissors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">So in his next competition, Fosbury went back to the scissors style. He explained, &ldquo;As the bar was raised each time, I began to lift my hips up and my shoulders went back in reaction to that. At the end of the competition I had improved my best by 15 cm to 1 m 78 and even placed third. The next two years in high school with my curved approach I began to lead with my shoulder and eventually was going over head first like today&rsquo;s Floppers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">D</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;In this way, the Flop evolved, not from design, but from a trial and error process which combined repeated effort with the biomechanics of Fosbury&rsquo;s gangling 1 m 93 physique. Sports Illustrated writer Richard Hoffer wrote, &rdquo;It was on-site engineering his body and mind working together making reflexive adjustment with only one goal getting over the bar. Hoffer explained that although Fosbury&rsquo;s arms and legs seemed to be all over the place, those movements that served to get him a centimeter higher were retained, while the others were gradually eliminated as the technique evolved.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">E</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;What did Fosbury think of the seeming awkwardness of his Flop? &ldquo;I believe that the Flop was a natural style,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;And I was just the first to find it. I can say that because the Canadian jumper Debbie Brill was a few years younger than I was and also developed the same technique only a few years after me and without ever having seen me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">A</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;striking coincidence? Yes indeed. But perhaps not as striking as the fact that a high school student called Bruce Quande was photographed on May 24, 1963 flopping backward over the crossbar. This was the same month that Fosbury recalls having flopped for the first time in the competition when he was at high school.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">F</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;But completing the Flop successfully was only half the battle the return to earth still had to be negotiated. Few would even consider such an experiment knowing they had have to land on their necks. When Fosbury was jumping in high school he had to land in pits which were filled with wood chips, sawdust or sand. On one occasion Fosbury hit his head on the wooden border or the pit. Another time he landed totally out of the pit, flat on his back knocking the wind out of him. The next year Fosbury&rsquo;s high school became the first in the region to install foam rubber in its high jump pit thereby cushioning the jumper&rsquo;s fall and encouraging the use of the potentially dangerous Flop. The Fosbury Flop and cushioned landing areas thus appear to have co-evolved.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">G</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Fosbury explains how he came to name the Flop. &ldquo;I am very proud that I received the naming rights. But the term by which the style is known did not appear overnight. To tell the truth the first time was that I was interviewed and asked &lsquo;What do you call this?&rsquo; I used my engineering analytical side and I referred to it as a back lay out.&rsquo; It was not interesting and the journalist didn&rsquo;t even write it down. I noted this. The next time that I was interviewed that&rsquo;s when I said: &lsquo;Well at home in my town they call it the Fosbury Flop&rsquo; &ndash; and everyone wrote it down. I was the first time to call it that but it came from a caption on a newspaper photo that said: &ldquo;Fosbury flops over bar.&rsquo; The context was that our town was on a river, very popular for fishing an hour from the Pacific Ocean. And when you land a fish on the bank it&rsquo;s flopping. That&rsquo;s the action and so it&rsquo;s a good description by a journalist and I remembered it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Questions 28-32<br></span><span class="c1 c0">The text above has seven sections A-G.

When I initially viewed my Poppi Properties flat I was accompanied by Lillee Eggerton one of the two staff who run the company. The flat was located close to the office where I have been working for the past year so I went there before the working day had begun. I knew immediately that it was the right property for me because of the convenient location and a few days later I paid the deposit and the first two months&rsquo; rent. The flat was on the 12th floor which I admit was a surprise to me as I thought it was lower when I first read about it but Lillee was very encouraging and I felt confident that I was making the right choice. At this point she was professional and kind but once I had moved into the property I discovered that she was far less approachable that she had been during the viewing period and whenever I tried to contact her she was unavailable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">At the start of my tenancy a number of issues were unsatisfactory in the property. For example as a new tenant you have a right to expect your flat to be clean. In fact carpets should be professionally cleaned but mine had not even been hoovered. I had hoped that this problem would be addressed quickly but nothing happened and so I did the job myself. Similarly, the oven worked when I switched it on, but it was black inside and smelt horrible. The company did nothing so in the end I just avoided using the oven while I lived there. Several times I asked to speak to the landlord directly but was told this was not possible. No one should have to put up with these problems particularly when Poppi Properties charges such high rents.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Questions 7-14<br></span><span class="c1 c0">Do the following statements agree with the information given in the text above?

This is called raising a grievance.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Often the best way to sort out a problem is to request an informal meeting with your immediate manager to explain your concerns. You may find it is possible to sort the problem out in this way without having to take any further action. However if you do not feel your problem has been solved you may decided to raise a formal grievance. In this case you should first try to find out your company&rsquo;s grievance procedure you should be able to find details of this in your Company Handbook, HR or Personnel manual or on your company&rsquo; HR internal site.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">The next step will probably be to write to your employer. Explain your problem and if you can think of a possible solution for resolving it give details of this. When you have written your letter check that you have written the date and retain a copy so that you have a record of what you wrote. Your employer should arrange an initial meeting at a reasonable time and place to discuss your grievance. You are entitled to ask either a colleague from work or a trade union representative to go to the meeting with you. After the meeting your employer should write to you telling you what they have decided to do about your grievance.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">If you don&rsquo;t agree with your employer&rsquo;s decision you have the right to appeal against it this must be done in writing. A further meeting should then be called which should be led by a more senior manager if possible. If you are still not satisfied with the decision made at this meeting you may consider whether one way to solve the problem might be through mediation. This be done inside the company or by an external agent. Alternatively you can make an employment tribunal claim. You must do this no more then three months after the time when the event you are complaining about happened. If your application is received after this time limit the tribunal will not usually accept it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Questions 15-21<br></span><span class="c0">Complete the flowchart below.

Taxis have a licence plate and roof sign that states they are taxi. As a taxi driver you might be booked in advance, wait on a taxi rank or pick up passengers while on the move. You could combine normal pick up jobs with prearranged contracts such as regular trips for schoolchildren or those unable to drive. You might also make longer distance trips such as taking people to airports. The other type of passenger transport is a private hire vehicle. As a private hire driver, you can only collect passengers who have pre booked through your operator. You cannot be flagged down in the street.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">When working in a taxi or private hire vehicle you would:<br>&bull; Take job details over the radio from the operator at the office or by an in-car computer<br>&bull; Help to load and unload passengers&rsquo; luggage<br>&bull; Assist passengers with any physical conditions that make it difficult for them to get in and out of the vehicle<br>&bull; Take payments<br>&bull; Keep the vehicle clean and roadworthy<br>&bull; Keep accounts and records if self employed</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Working conditions and skills<br></span><span class="c1 c0">You would spend most of your time on the road sometimes in heavy traffic and you would be constantly on the move.

In the UK, 17% of taxi drivers are employed full time, 17% are employed part time and 66% are self employed. As well as being a skilled driver you need to be good at communicating with people and helping customers. You must be tactful when dealing with problems and have good time management and numeracy skills.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Requirements<br></span><span class="c1 c0">You will need a special licence from your local authority to be a taxi driver or private care hire driver.

One type of rhubarb is grown in the dark to produce longer, rosier stalks and this is called forced rhubarb.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">A</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;In the north of England, a cold winter is good news for some and not just snowmen and woolly hat makers. According to Yorkshire farmer David Westwood, this year&rsquo;s forced rhubarb is the best for years. Westwood, a softly spoken Yorkshiremen should know. He&rsquo;s been growing and selling rhubarb for 62 years since he started picking on the farm aged 11. His son Jonathan works on the farm too, making him the sixth generation of the Westwoods to grow the pink stems of petioles as they are otherwise known.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">B</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;We meet at his farm a few miles from the city of Wakefield which with the cities of Bradford and Leeds form the three points of the Rhubarb Triangle, the heart of the British rhubarb industry. &lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t grow as well anywhere else,&rsquo; insists Westwood. He has a number of theories as to why this is. The loam soil on a clay base is perfect for the roots or crowns which rhubarb grows from. In Victorian times &ndash; the mid to late 1800s &ndash; when rhubarb&rsquo;s popularity was at its peak the local coal mines provided cheap fuel for heating the sheds a crucial part of the forcing process which involves depriving the plants of light as they develop. At the same time the effluence from the industry enriched the soil for farmers. On top of that according to Westwood the high levels of pollution in the air would have been ideal for the rhubarb as rhubarb loves soot.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">C</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Westwood&rsquo;s farm produces both the greenish outdoor rhubarb the kind that grows well in gardens all over the country and the startingly pink forced rhubarb. It&rsquo;s this that is the cream of the crop the upper class of the rhubarb family. Forced rhubarb is the one that&rsquo;s most likely to convert rhubarb haters who&rsquo;ve been traumatised by harshly flavoured school pies made from green overgrown outdoor stems. The slender magenta spears, with a sherbet-tangy flavour and delicate texture are a far cry from that coarse bitter stuff. It&rsquo;s also a rare local fruit (although technically a vegetable) at a time when imports dominate and a welcome splash of color in the drab winter months. No wonder chefs and food writers have fallen in love with forced rhubarb al over again. It&rsquo;s enjoying a remarkable renaissance for only 20 years ago it was in such decline that Westwood one of the last 12 growers left from a peak of 2000, was considering abandoning it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">D</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;There are certainly simpler ways to grow food. First the plant roots or crowns are grown outside for more than two years. Then at the start of their third winter they are left in the ground until it is cold enough to break the crown&rsquo;s dormancy. This is one of the factors that gives British rhubarb the edge over imports from the Netherlands which arrive in the country a scene stealing couple of weeks before the Yorkshire crop. To bring them to market that early the Dutch crowns are fed with gibberellic acid to replace the hormones naturally generated by a period of cold weather. Westwood is relaxed on the subject of the imported rhubarb remarking only. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good looking all right but the flavor&rsquo;s nowhere near.&rdquo; Back in Yorkshire sometime around the middle of November the crowns are dug up transferred to shed with earthen floors and watered in. The light is blocked out completely and the heating is turned on. In the warm and dark the shoots appear so quickly that the buds can be heard gently popping. Withing 3 weeks or so the first round of picking or pulling as it&rsquo;s known can begin.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">E</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;In Westwood&rsquo;s 1920s rhubarb sheds it is pitch black. I slip and slide on the narrow troughs that serve as paths between the beds of rhubarb crowns. It&rsquo;s a relief when a team of pullers arrive all local men some of whom have been working for Westwood for 40 years. Each carries a sturdy candle and their pale flickering light reveals a sea of yellow leaves stretching 40 meters to the far wall. The men walk the beds plucking the satiny stems expertly choosing only the ones that have reached the length of an arm. Then cradling the fuchsia pink bundles in their arms they move on to the next patch. It&rsquo;s an extraordinary sight in this age of mechanised, computerised agriculture. &lsquo;The pulling&rsquo;s done much the same way as it always has been&rsquo; Westwood says. &lsquo;Electric light spoils the color.&rsquo; A labour intensive process it goes some way to explain the admittedly eye-watering price of the best forced rhubarb that and the heating now from oil or propane rather than coal.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">F</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;So how was this arcane cold dark heat process in use since Victorian times discovered? Westwood&rsquo;s story is appealingly earthy. A gardener threw an old crown onto the horse stable muck pile the manure was hot, and plant was soon covered. The stable boy must have been puzzled by the startling pink spears that came pushing through the dirt a week or two later but happily he had the good sense to gather them. Where there&rsquo;s muck there&rsquo;s money &ndash; and good eating indeed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Questions 28-33<br></span><span class="c1 c0">The text above has six paragraph A-F.

We are going to cut down a tall tree that is inside the boundary of a busy timer yard. It&rsquo;s Saturday not a working day for the yard and it is far easier to remove a tree when no one else is around. As supervisor I first pop into our office to sort out the paperwork for the day which includes the risk assessments. Then I look at the most up to date weather forecast as wind and rain make our job much more difficult. Luckily we have picked a good day.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Next we load up the equipment &ndash; things like petrol driven chainsaws of varying sizes, helmets and waterproofs, spades, rakes and other tools etc. must all go on the truck before the three of us set off. On arrival at the site we have a quick discussion on the procedure for the day. After that one of &ndash; today it&rsquo;s Gary &ndash; goes up the tree to quickly select his anchor point. This is the position from which he will cut down the tree. It must be high enough to enable access throughout the tree&rsquo;s branches but also have sufficient strength to support the climber. The first few big branches can be cut from the tree in large pieces and dropped into the yard so we make good progress during the morning and start our wood pile there.<br>Having removed the more accessible branches we have lunch and then set up a simple system to reach the smaller upper branches. This involves placing a pulley in the tree and using thick rope to drag the branches down. When they are cut these will fall further away outside the boundary of the yard. On the other side of the perimeter fence is a wide grass verge and then a footpath where I set up a number of signs to alert the public to our activities. Working alongside a road requires vigilance so I monitor the movements of pedestrians and as Gary starts work I watch what he is doing so it can ensure safety. Once the branches are on the ground I throw them back over the fence to Mikael who cuts them up and feeds the machine that dices them into very small pieces called woo chippings.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Questions 15-21<br></span><span class="c0">Complete the flowchart below.

They may need to take place in a narrow space that is often only about 35 cm deep. In addition the floors are typically covered with a wood product, engineered to resemble solid wood that has very strict criteria as far as drilling and cutting are concerned. The plumber cannot just go in and cut holes and lay pipes. He must first think about what he is doing read and understand the cutting chart that accompanies each of his tools and visualise how his work will impact on other tradespeople before proceeding.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Commercial plumbers working on office buildings, hotels, restaurants etc. have the same issues and coordination problems as residential plumbers but often have to install equipment that is more sophisticated. This is because it forms part of integrated systems where mechanical work and plumbing work are combined. The equipment will have specific installation instructions so it is critical that the plumber has the cognitive ability to understand these. In addition often the structures are complex, and the floors and walls must be X-rayed prior to drilling to order to avoid hitting key elements such as reinforcing steel.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Service plumbers go in where others have been and often face situations where they must troubleshoot various possible causes of a plumbing problem. In order to do this effectively they must have complete knowledge of say a customer&rsquo;s shower until they are servicing even if they did not install it. They must have the ability to translate the symptoms they can see such as leaks and blockages into the actual problem and then take the appropriate action to rectify the issue in a fast and cost effective way. Often service plumbers encounter residential or commercial customers who are either facing great inconvenience or have had their operations severely disrupted because of a plumbing issue. Successful service plumbers not only need good mechanical skills but they typically need very good people skills to provide necessary support.</span></p><p class="c3 c17"><span class="c1 c0"><br><br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Questions 22-27<br></span><span class="c0">Complete the table below.

Twenty breeding pairs of rare hazel dormice were recently reintroduced as part of a national scheme to reverse the decline of one of Britain&rsquo;s most threatened mammals. This reintroduction led by the People&rsquo;s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES) and supported by a coalition of conservation groups is the 22nd in the last 23 years. Dormice depend on well managed woodlands and healthy connected hedgerows for their survival. But changes in land use since the 1940s have been so dramatic that the dormice that remain have limited living space and are increasingly isolated.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Ahead of the release the PTES found a site of dense good quality woodland while the captive bred dormice waited in quarantine. After examination by vets the dormice were placed in their soft release accommodation in pairs. This consisted of secure wooden boxes fitted to trees and surrounded by a meter square cage. For 10 days the dormice were checked and given food daily then a small opening was made allowing them the freedom to explore while retaining the security of the cage. Everything was removed in October when the animals started preparing to go into hibernation for the winter.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">&lsquo;The hope is that we have a free living population in the wood but we won&rsquo;t know how they have fared until next year&rsquo; said Ian White of the PTES. Unsuitable habitat, captive bred animals and incorrect management could all ruin the chances of success of such schemes. However a distinctive factor of this release White explained is the intention of linking up with another released dormouse population 3 miles away by managing the land between. The goal is to create a wider landscape for dormice and that will make the population more robust.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Woodlands were traditionally managed through regularly cutting back certain trees to ground level to stimulate growth and provide firewood or timber for local residents. This system was known as coppicing, and as an added bonus it happened to provide varied food and plenty of light for dormice. But the practice has been largely lost with much remaining woodland sliced up by roads railways and fields. England also had more than 50% of its hedgerows dug up between 1946 and 1993 as small fields were combined to make larger ones and farmland was sold for building projects. All this has had an adverse effect on dormouse populations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s very important that we reintroduce the dormouse because they are a good species to get people involved with conservation,&rsquo; said White. &lsquo;They are a fascinating species that is rare but you can still see. They promote good woodland management and what&rsquo;s good for dormice is good for a large range of species.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Helen Meech the director of Rewilding Britain, an organisation campaigning to restore lost species and habitats to the British countryside said that such reintroductions would increase people&rsquo;s familiarity with living with more wild animals once again. People&rsquo;s everyday wildlife experience is becoming limited to seeing grey squirrels and pigeons she explained. &lsquo;We are increasingly disconnected from nature. In 30 to 40 years&rsquo; time we might get to the point where we can start to think about bringing back wolves, bison or moose but let&rsquo;s start with species that will have a lighter impact for now.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Over centuries, Britain has lost many key species that are critical for healthy ecosystems. Here are some of the species conservationists have reintroduced or are proposing to reintroduce.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">The lynx is believed to have disappeared from Britain about 1000 year ago. Experts say it would help control the fast growing population of red deer allowing forests to regenerate and support greater biodiversity. The preference of the lynx a shy animal to stay in its woodland habitat would make a threat to livestock of humans unlikely.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">After an absence of 400 years beavers are back in Britain. The Devon Beaver project cites improvements in biodiversity and water after the reintroduction of a pair near Okehampton in 2011. Scotland&rsquo;s first reintroduction in Knapdale forest in 2009 was hailed an outstanding success but an unlicensed free living population in the river Tay has caused problems.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Lost to Britain in the 1700s the wolf is the most controversial species proposed for reintroduction given its potential to kill agricultural livestock. But they are critical to the restoration of ecosystems that have been overgrazed by deer. Despite their fearsome reputation they present a low risk to people. Because of the space a wolf population would need the Scottish Highlands would be an obvious place for their reintroduction and could generate millions of pounds in tourism.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">The sea eagle also known as the white tailed eagle was driven to extinction in Britain earlier this century. A reintroduction programme has seen it return to the Inner Hebrides island of Mull. Proposals to bring it back to the east of England failed following concerns from landowners about the threat to livestock. Successful schemes in Europe have offered compensation for this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Then there is the wild boar which disappeared in the 13th century because of hunting. They increase biodiversity and create space for trees and plants to grow but can cause damage to crops and gardens. The species has been quietly re-establishing itself in the woodlands of Britain for several decades.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Questions 28-31<br></span><span class="c0">Complete the summary below.
